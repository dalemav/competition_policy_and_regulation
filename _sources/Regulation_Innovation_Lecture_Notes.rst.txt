.. _Innovation:

Competition policy, IP rights and innovation
--------------------------------------------

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Why do we care about the relation between competition and innovation?

   -  We know that competition improves static efficiency (reduces the
      deadweight loss)
   -  However, if more intense competition would reduce innovation, this
      loss is probably bigger than the gain in consumer surplus
   -  Better to have a product that is expensive than one that has not
      been invented at all
   -  On the other hand, if more intense competition stimulates
      innovation, then competition improves both static and dynamic
      efficiency
   -  Then the arguments to liberalize and deregulate sectors become
      stronger.
   -  When a competition authority calculates the value it creates for
      society, it should not only focus on lower prices for consumers
      but also take into account that competition leads to more, better
      and cheaper products.
   -  Further, if a merger is expected to increase market power, it will
      not only raise prices but also reduce innovation. Gives even
      stronger arguments to abolish the merger.
   -  how does the relation between competition and innovation affect IP
      law?

Incentives
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Ex ante vs Ex post competition

   -  An intuition that is often mentioned is that under perfect
      competition there cannot be innovation: with each firm pricing at
      marginal costs, profits are zero and hence there is no incentive
      to innovate.
   -  This intuition is incorrect as it confuses ex ante and ex post
      competition.
   -  Obviously, if you invent a cheaper way to produce products, the
      (intellectual) property right should be protected (e.g. through a
      patent or through secrecy)
   -  Hence, ex post your competitors should not have free access to
      your innovation; this will create market power for the inventor ex
      post
   -  However, the first question we are interested in is: how does ex
      ante competition affect the incentives to innovate?
   -  We will look at a number of "stories" here:

      -  competition enhances the incentive to innovate directly
      -  competition enhances the incentive to innovate by disciplining
         firms' managers
      -  competition raises the incentives to innovate, but reduces it
         for very high "levels of competition" (inverse U)

-  Competition raises innovation

   -  Consider a market with linear demand \\(x=1-p\\) where the current
      state of the art technology produces the product with constant
      marginal costs \\(c > 0\\).
   -  Assume a new technology can be invented that reduces marginal
      costs to \\(c' =0\\)
   -  If there is a monopoly in the sector, she will maximize profits
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:Mon} (p-c)(1-p) \\end{equation}
   -  *TODO* the monopolist chooses \\(p=\\textstyle{1\\over 2} (1+c)\\)
      and profit equals \\(\\pi^m = \\textstyle{1\\over 4}
      (1-c)^2\\). **check**
   -  The incentive for the monopolist to innovate is given by
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:IncMon} \\Delta^m =
      \\textstyle{1\\over 4} - \\textstyle{1\\over 4}(1-c)^2
      \\end{equation}
   -  Now assume that we have at least two firms who play a Bertrand
      game.
   -  Before the innovation, \\(p^B = c\\) and all firms have zero
      profits.
   -  If one firm gets the patent on the innovation, his profits equal
      (assuming \\(c < \\textstyle{1\\over 2}\\)) \\(\\pi^B = c(1-c)\\)
   -  Hence the incentive to innovate equals
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:IncBertr} \\Delta^B = c(1-c)
      \\end{equation}
   -  *TODO* which exceeds \\(\\Delta^m\\) **check**
   -  intuition: competition forces the firm to produce more and hence
      the reduction in marginal costs (\\(c'-c\\)) yields a gain over a
      higher output level
   -  If \\(c \\geq \\textstyle{1\\over 2}\\), the price after the
      innovation does not equal \\(c\\) but equals the monopoly price
      \\(\\textstyle{1\\over 2}\\) (innovation is drastic)
   -  In that case, \\(\\pi^B = \\pi^m\\) after the innovation. But
      before innovating, the Bertrand profit equals 0 while monopoly
      profit is strict positive
   -  This is called the Arrow replacement effect: a monopolist replaces
      herself and therefore has less incentive to innovate.
   -  If competition is intensified through entry by firms under, say,
      Cournot competition, each firm's output level goes down (also
      after innovation) and hence such an increase in competition may
      reduce the incentive to innovate.

-  competition disciplines managers Aghion et al. (1999)

   -  Above we assumed that firms were run by their owners and hence
      maximized profits
   -  many firms are run by managers who do not own all equity
   -  These managers do not necessarily maximize profits
   -  Assume that such managers want to minimize effort and that
      adopting and implementing innovations requires managers' efforts
   -  Then managers will tend to reduce their effort as much as
      possible, unless they are about to go bankrupt (in which case they
      lose their salary and other on-the-job perks)
   -  By intensifying competition, firms' profits are reduced and hence
      the threat of bankruptcy comes more quickly
   -  After the increase in competition managers are forced to innovate
      more to avoid bankruptcy
   -  Hence the effect here is: more competition reduces profits and
      thereby raises innovation

-  Inverted U

   -  Aghion et al. (2005) show empirically that there may be both a
      positive and negative effect of competition on innovation
   -  They consider the following duopoly model
   -  There are two firms in an industry that compete over time in both
      production and innovation
   -  The two firms may have the same technology (say, same cost level);
      in that case they are \`\`level''
   -  If one of these firms innovates, he gets one step ahead (\\(+1\\))
      of the other firm who then lags one step behind (\\(-1\\))
   -  By assumption, firms cannot be more than one step apart
   -  A firm that is one step ahead (behind) makes profits \\(\\pi\_{+1}
      (\\pi\_{-1})\\). These profits are given.
   -  Level firms make a profit equal to \\(\\pi\_0 \\in
      [0,\\textstyle{1\\over 2} \\pi^m\_0]\\), the higher this profit
      is, the less competitive the industry
   -  If \\(\\pi\_0 = \\textstyle{1\\over 2} \\pi^m\\) each firm makes
      half the monopoly profit due to a cartel; with \\(\\pi\_0 =0\\) we
      have Bertrand competition.
   -  What are the incentives to innovate?

      -  If both firms are level, as a first approx. the gain to
         innovating equals \\(\\Delta\_0 = \\pi\_{+1} - \\pi\_0\\)
         because if a firm innovates, it moves one step ahead and makes
         profits equal to \\(\\pi\_{+1}\\) instead of \\(\\pi\_0\\)
      -  Similarly, when the firm lags behind, the incentive to catch up
         equals \\(\\Delta\_{-1} = \\pi\_0 - \\pi\_{-1}\\)

   -  Modelling an increase in competition as a fall in \\(\\pi\_0\\),
      we find that such an increase in competition raises
      \\(\\Delta\_0\\) while it reduces \\(\\Delta\_{-1}\\)
   -  In other words, more intense competition increases the incentive
      to innovate to escape the competition but it reduces the incentive
      to catch up
   -  When competition is weak, the sector is level most of the time (as
      there is hardly an incentive to escape the competition), hence an
      increase in competition in this case will raise innovation (on
      average) in this industry
   -  As competition keeps on increasing, the sector is (on average)
      more often unlevel (as the escape the competition effect is
      increased while the catch up effect is reduced)
   -  Hence for high enough competition intensity, the sector is almost
      always unlevel and a further increase in competition reduces
      innovation (on average) as the reduction in the catch up effect
      dominates the escape the competition effect
   -  In this case, one finds an inverse U relation between competition
      and innovation

-  Schumpeterian argument

   -  Sometimes, people claim that Schumpeter's argument for market
      power to stimulate innovation should be interpreted as pointing to
      capital market imperfections
   -  The idea is then that R&D is intangible capital (you cannot take a
      mortgage on R&D investment as you can on an office building)
   -  Hence it is hard for the capital market to finance R&D
   -  Therefore R&D needs to be financed out of retained earnings
   -  The more (ex ante) market power a firm has, the higher its profits
      and thus the more R&D it can finance itself
   -  Due to the capital market imperfection, a reduction in competition
      intensity increases innovation
   -  In principle this may be true, however, it is not obvious
   -  The capital market imperfection stems from the problem that debt
      and equity holders cannot monitor the way the money is spent (e.g.
      whether it is really spent on R&D or whether a manager is giving
      presents to friends and family)
   -  As capital providers cannot be sure that the money is well spent,
      they do not lend money to the firm
   -  Given these problems, how can we be sure that the higher profits
      (due to reduced competition) will be spent efficiently on R&D?

Antitrust and innovation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  models above consider the effect of competition, not directly
   "competition policy"
-  `Segal and Whinston (2007) <http://www.stanford.edu/~isegal/at_innovation.pdf>`__ model
   antitrust policy in a more concrete way
-  question is whether competition policy should be different in
   innovative industries
-  in competition policy lectures we have considered attempts by
   incumbents to exclude entrants
-  we derived conditions under which such behaviour is profitable for
   incumbents but bad for welfare
-  one way to introduce innovation into this story is to assume that an
   entrant can innovate to enter the industry
-  if the incumbent uses exclusionary practices, entry becomes harder
-  antitrust policy reducing such practices stimulates entry (direct
   effect) and hence innovation
-  but with this antitrust policy, the entrant knows that she cannot use
   exclusionary practices once she has entered successfully
-  this indirect effect reduces the incentives to innovate by the
   entrant
-  Segal and Whinston analyze the overall effect of policies aimed at
   reducing exclusionary practices
-  model

   -  duopoly model, incumbent \\(I\\) and (potential) entrant \\(E\\)
   -  only entrant can invest \\(c(\\phi)\\) to innovate with
      probability \\(\\phi\\); \\(c,c',c^{\\prime\\prime} >0\\)
   -  if entrant innovates, she receives patent on product which is
      \\(\\Delta > 0\\) better than incumbent's product
   -  if entrant does not innovate, incumbent has profits
      \\(\\pi\_{m}\\)
   -  if entrant innovates and enters, in the period of entry profits
      are given by \\(\\pi\_{I},\\pi\_{E}\\)
   -  then incumbent leaves the market and becomes potential entrant
      next period
   -  discount factor \\(\\delta \\in \\langle 0,1 \\rangle\\)
   -  Bellman equations take the following form
      \\begin{eqnarray} V\_{I} &=& \\pi\_{m}+\\delta V\_{I} + \\phi
      [\\pi\_{I} -\\pi\_{m} + \\delta(V\_{E}-V\_{I})] \\\\ V\_{E} &=&
      -c(\\phi) + \\delta V\_{E} + \\phi[\\pi\_{E} +
      \\delta(V\_{I}-V\_{E})] \\end{eqnarray}
   -  first order condition: \\(c'(\\phi) = \\pi\_{E} +
      \\delta(V\_{I}-V\_{E})\\)
   -  *TODO* solve the two Bellman equations to find **check**
      \\begin{equation} c'(\\phi) =
      \\frac{[1-\\delta(1-\\phi)]\\pi\_{E}+\\delta[\\phi\\pi\_{I}+(1-\\phi)\\pi\_{m}+c(\\phi)]}{1-\\delta+2
      \\delta\\phi} \\end{equation}
   -  \\(c^{\\prime\\prime}>0\\) implies that left hand side is increasing in
      \\(\\phi\\)
   -  assume that right hand side is decreasing in \\(\\phi\\)
   -  if competition policy can increase the right hand side, it raises
      \\(\\phi\\) and hence stimulates innovation
   -  let \\(\\alpha\\) parameterize competition policy with higher
      \\(\\alpha\\) denoting more strict competition policy
   -  we can write the three profit levels as a function of
      \\(\\alpha\\):
      \\(\\pi\_{m}(\\alpha),\\pi\_{E}(\\alpha),\\pi\_{I}(\\alpha)\\)
   -  then an increase in \\(\\alpha\\) stimulates innovation if
      \\begin{equation} (A)~\\pi'\_{E}(\\alpha) + \\delta
      \\frac{(1-\\phi)\\pi'\_{m}(\\alpha)+\\phi
      \\pi'\_{I}(\\alpha)}{1-\\delta(1-\\phi)} > 0 \\end{equation}
   -  the first term denotes the direct effect of antitrust policy on
      entrant's profits
   -  but once the entrant is in the market, next period (discounted by
      \\(\\delta\\)) she is the incumbent
   -  discounted profits of being an incumbent equal sum of
      \\(\\pi\_{m}\\) (before entry; probability \\(1-\\phi\\) each
      period) and \\(\\pi\_{I}\\) (after entry; probability \\(\\phi\\)
      each period)
   -  effective discount rate takes \\(\\delta\\) and probability
      \\(\\phi\\) of being replaced by entry into account:
      \\begin{equation}
      1+\\delta(1-\\phi)+[\\delta(1-\\phi)]^{2}+[\\delta(1-\\phi)]^{3}+
      \\ldots = \\frac{1}{1-\\delta(1-\\phi)} \\end{equation}

-  exclusionary practices

   -  in this model we can model exclusion as follows
   -  for each producer, costs of production equal 0
   -  each producer of leading technology (whether \\(I\\) or \\(E\\))
      charges price \\(p=\\Delta\\) (just undercuts previous best
      technology)
   -  at the end of each period, incumbent can make a fraction \\(B\\)
      of consumers an exclusive offer: buy from incumbent next period at
      price \\(q\\)

      -  let \\(v\\) denote the value of the current incumbent's product
      -  if consumer does not sign such an exclusive offer:

         -  with prob. \\(1-\\phi\\) there is no entry and incumbent
            charges \\(p^{m}=\\Delta\\): consumer surplus
            \\(v-\\Delta\\)
         -  with probability \\(\\phi\\) there is entry, value of new
            product: \\(v+\\Delta\\), consumer surplus \\(v\\)

      -  if consumer signs contract, surplus equals \\(v-q\\)
      -  \\(q\\) solves \\((1-\\phi)(v-\\Delta)+\\phi v = v-q\\) and
         hence \\(q=(1-\\phi)\\Delta\\)
      -  *TODO* hence we find that **check**
         \\begin{eqnarray} \\pi\_{m} &=& (1-B) \\Delta + B
         (1-\\phi)\\Delta \\\\ \\pi\_{I} &=& B(1-\\phi) \\Delta \\\\
         \\pi\_{E} &=& (1-B)\\Delta \\end{eqnarray}
      -  competition policy limits the possibilities for exclusion: \\(B
         \\leq 1-\\alpha\\)
      -  the higher \\(\\alpha\\), the less consumers can be captured
         with an exclusive contract
      -  since \\(I\\) wants to reduce the probability of entry
         \\(\\phi\\), choose \\(B\\) as high as possible:
         \\(B=1-\\alpha\\)
      -  profits are given by
         \\begin{eqnarray} \\pi\_{m} &=& \\alpha \\Delta + (1-\\alpha)
         (1-\\phi)\\Delta \\\\ \\pi\_{I} &=& (1-\\alpha)(1-\\phi)
         \\Delta \\\\ \\pi\_{E} &=& \\alpha\\Delta \\end{eqnarray}
      -  substitute this into equation (A):
      -  *TODO* \\(\\alpha\\) raises \\(c'(\\phi)\\) (and hence
         \\(\\phi\\)) because
         \\(\\pi'\_{E}(\\alpha)=\\Delta>0\\) **check**
      -  competition policy reducing the possibilities for exclusion
         raises innovation

Policy implications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We have considered a number of arguments why more intense competition
   raises innovation
-  More intense competition increases firms' output levels and thereby
   the incentive to reduce costs
-  A monopolist with market power also makes profits if she does not
   invent: Arrow's replacement effect
-  Competition reduces current profits and thereby stimulates innovation
   (by reducing the replacement effect)
-  Competition disciplines managers to implement innovations
-  If competition is very intense, a further increase in competition may
   reduce innovation: inverse U
-  reducing exclusionary practices raises entrant's profits and hence
   stimulates innovation

   - In lecture on competition policy a similar argument was seen where
     :ref:`tying <tying>` reduces
     incentives to do R&D for an entrant

-  All these effects are about ex ante competition; ex post (after
   innovation is found) the inventer should be protected from imitation
   by competitors

Intellectual Property rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Why do we need laws to protect IP?

   -  We don't have laws to specifically protect your bike

      -  IP is a public good: you can steal it, without the owner losing
         it

   -  without IP protection, not much incentive to invest resources into
      innovation:

      -  if your investments are successful, others will copy your
         innovation and you cannot recoup your investment

   -  property rights can be traded

      -  allows for specialization: some people invent, others
         commercialize

-  Intellectual property (IP) law is often in the news

   -  creates controversy: should software be protected or should an
      open source model be used?
   -  numerous court cases on patents in mobile devices (apple, samsung
      etc.)
   -  trivial patents: `Amazon's one click shopping patent. <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/amazonpatent.html>`_

      -  and why `some people don't like this. <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/amazon.html>`_

   -  creates market power and hence a deadweightloss

      -  how can we design IP law such as to stimulate innovation but
         minimize the inefficiencies of market power?

-  Current US law

   -  A patent gives its owner the right to sue for infringement if
      anyone tries to make, use, sell, offer, import the invention into
      the country issuing the patent
   -  If you invent something, you can patent the invention if it meets
      four requirements:

      -  patentable subject matter:

         -  Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and courts tend to find
            new technologies patentable
         -  moral debate whether life forms are patentable
         -  our focus is: something should be patentable if there is an
            incentive issue
         -  US patent 5,794,207 describes a method for conducting a
            Dutch auction; but Dutch auctions have been used for
            centuries
         -  hard to see what the incentive justification is for such a
            patent
         -  patent then only creates market power which is bad for
            welfare

      -  utility: invention must offer some positive benefit for society

         -  mainly used to deny a patent for drugs that have not been
            shown to be safe and effective

      -  novelty: no patent if "invention" has been previously described
      -  non-obviousness: even if the invention was not previously
         described, it could be a trivial extension of existing
         knowledge

   -  maximum duration of a patent is twenty years from the date of
      filing

      -  economic lifetime may be (a lot) shorter if new innovation
         replaces the existing patented technology

   -  Patent breadth:

      -  patent monopoly would be meaningless if limited exactly to the
         original invention (blue post-it notes)
      -  patent claim is deemed to cover any product that "does the same
         work in substantially the same way to accomplish substantially
         the same result"

   -  Both patent breadth and patent duration affect the profitability
      of an innovation: what is the trade off between these two policy
      instruments?

      -  should we have narrow patents with a long duration
      -  or short duration but broad protection?

   -  Another way to protect your invention is to keep it secret
   -  Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) protects individuals and
      businesses against the "misappropriation of trade secrets by
      improper means"
   -  A trade secret can include any information that

      -  derives economic value from not being readily known to others
      -  whose owner has taken reasonable steps to keep it secret
      -  is not publicly available

   -  duration and breadth: a company can keep anything secret,
      potentially forever
   -  difference with patents:

      -  trade secret does not need to be novel; no requirement on
         subject matter
      -  information is not disclosed to general public

   -  Hence trade secrecy laws do the opposite of patent law:

      -  patent law requires disclosure of information so that everyone
         knows what is protected
      -  knowledge enters the public domain such that it cam be used for
         future research

-  Economics: incentives to innovate

   -  the economic view on patent design is driven by incentives
   -  if you invent something that is not protected: everybody copies it
   -  you don't earn anything and hence you do not innovate in the first
      place
   -  It is not obvious that this view is always correct

      -  there may be a strong (intrinsic) motivation different from
         making a profit from your invention
      -  to illustrate, what motivates open source software developers?

   -  optimal patent design: maximize incentive to innovate while
      minimizing damage
   -  we consider this trade off in two models:

      -  optimal patent duration and breadth
      -  optimal (overall) profitability of patents

-  Patent breadth versus duration

   -  Consider a firm that needs to invest \\(V\\) to invent a new
      product \\(x\\)
   -  Once the product is invented, demand for \\(x\\) is given by
      \\(F(p)\\) if no other product varieties are available
   -  with \\(F'(p)<0\\) and \\(x\\) is produced with zero marginal
      costs
   -  let \\(w\\) denote patent breadth and \\(T\\) patent duration
   -  once patent expires, competitors will copy it and profits drop to
      zero
   -  before patent expires, competitors can produce a product \\(x'\\)
      that is distance \\(w\\) away from \\(x\\) and can be produced at
      zero marginal costs
   -  Bertrand competition on \\(x'\\) market leads to a price for
      \\(x'\\) equal to 0
   -  consumer is characterized by travel cost \\(t\\) per unit of
      distance that product is removed from "ideal" product \\(x\\)
   -  hence consumer \\(t\\) buys \\(x\\) at price \\(p\\) (\\(x'\\) at
      price 0) if and only if \\(p < (>) 0+wt\\)
   -  assume that \\(t\\) is distributed with cumulative distribution
      function \\(H(t)=1-G(t)\\)
   -  then demand for product \\(x\\) is given by \\(F(p)G(p/w)\\)
   -  for given \\(w\\), patent holder solves
      \\begin{equation} \\pi(w) = \\max\_p F(p)G(p/w)(p-0)
      \\end{equation}
   -  denote the solution to this problem \\(p(w)\\)
   -  The deadweight loss is given by
      \\begin{equation} D(w) = \\int\_{0}^{p(w)} F(p)G(p/w)dp - \\pi(w)
      \\end{equation}
   -  firm innovates if \\(\\int\_0^T \\pi(w) e^{-rt} dt \\geq V\\)
   -  We assume that the government wants to minimize the deadweight
      loss; hence the inequality holds with equality:
      \\begin{equation} \\pi(w) \\frac{1-e^{-rT}}{r} = V \\end{equation}
   -  social planner solves
      \\begin{equation} \\min\_{w,T} \\frac{1-e^{-rT}}{r} D(w) \\text{
      subject to } \\pi(w) \\frac{1-e^{-rT}}{r} = V \\end{equation}
   -  or equivalently
      \\begin{equation} \\min\_{w} V D(w)/\\pi(w) \\end{equation}
   -  optimal patent breadth \\(w^\*\\) minimizes the ratio
      \\(D(w)/\\pi(w)\\)
   -  optimal duration \\(T^\*\\) is given by the solution to
      \\begin{equation} \\frac{1-e^{-rT^\*}}{r} \\pi(w) = V
      \\end{equation}
   -  Hence the optimal patent breadth for a product is determined by
      the breadth that minimizes the ratio of deadweight loss over
      profits
   -  intuitively, this gives the lowest deadweight loss per euro of
      profits
   -  if a judge needs to decide on an infringement (and he would focus
      on incentives issues) he should interpret the patent as giving a
      broad protection if \\(w^\*\\) is high

-  Patent profitability

   -  how profitable should a patent be?
   -  In other words, what is the optimal value for \\(V\\)?
   -  assume each individual can have (at max.) one idea for an
      innovation

      -  social welfare generated by an innovation is given by
         \\(W(V)\\) with \\(W'(V)<0\\) because higher \\(V\\) leads (via
         higher \\(w\\) and \\(T\\)) to higher deadweight loss
      -  if γ is invested, there is a probability \\(p \\in \\langle
         0,1]\\) that innovation is found
      -  assume that γ is distributed with c.d.f. \\(F(\\gamma)\\)
      -  only individuals with \\(\\gamma \\leq pV\\) invest
      -  Hence social planner solves
         \\begin{equation} \\max\_V F(pV) W(V) \\end{equation}
      -  higher \\(V\\) leads to more innovations
      -  but also higher profits (and higher deadweight loss) for
         (infra-marginal) innovations that would have been invested in
         anyway

   -  patents can be too profitable
   -  over/under-investment in R&D: business stealing vs.
      appropriability effect

      -  consider a patent race: \\(n\\) firms invest \\(\\gamma\\) to
         find (the same) innovation
      -  for each firm probability of success equals \\(p \\in \\langle
         0,1 \\rangle\\)
      -  overall probability of success \\(P(n) = 1-p^n\\)
      -  *TODO* we have \\(P(0)=0,P'(n) = -(\\ln p)p^n >0,P^{\\prime\\prime}(n) = -(\\ln
         p)^2 p^n <0\\) **check**
      -  probability that firm \\(i\\) wins the patent race:
         \\(P(n)/n\\)

         - free entry into the R&D market leads to equilibrium number
            \\(n^e\\) of firms determined by

         \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:market} \\frac{P(n^e)}{n^e} V =
         \\gamma \\end{equation}

          - social planner chooses \\(n^\*\\) which solves

         \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:planner} P'(n^\*)W(V) = \\gamma
         \\end{equation}

      -  comparing these two equations, we see two externalities:
      -  appropriability effect: \\(W(V) > V\\): surplus generated by an
         innovation exceeds the profits of the innovation
      -  patent has only finite duration
      -  unless firm can use perfect price discrimination, firm cannot
         appropriate all consumer surplus
      -  business stealing effect: \\(P(n)/n > P'(n)\\):
      -  planner considers the effect of having an additional firm doing
         R&D
      -  firm overlooks that by entering he steals business from
         incumbent firms; hence his incentive to enter is \\(V\\)
      -  appropriability effect leads to under-investment in R&D by the
         market
      -  business stealing effect leads to over-investment in R&D by the
         market

-  Policy implications

   -  patent protection stimulates innovation (dynamic efficiency) but
      also creates deadweight loss (static efficiency)
   -  optimal patent breadth minimizes deadweight loss per euro of
      profits
   -  patent length is chosen to make the innovation profitable
   -  by raising profitability of innovations, more new products get
      invented but deadweight loss is increased for products that would
      have been invented anyway

Exercise
~~~~~~~~

-  question 1 [25 points] Innovation

   Consider a market with demand of the form \\(p=1-q\\). Current
   constant marginal costs equals \\(c \\leq 1/2\\).

   (a) [2 points] Assume that there is a monopolist in this market. Show
   that his output level equals \\(q^{m}=(1-c)/2\\) and profits equal
   \\(\\pi^m = (1-c)^2/4\\).

   (b) [3 points] If this monopolist can invest to reduce his production
   costs \\(c\\), show that his incentive to do so is –at the margin–
   given by

   \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:23} \\frac{\\partial \\pi^m}{\\partial
   c} = - \\frac{1-c}{2} \\end{equation}

   Why is this derivative negative?

   (c) [3 points] Now assume that there are two firms in this market
   competing in quantities (Cournot). Firm 1 has constant marginal costs
   \\(c\_1 \\leq 1/2\\) and firm 2 \\(c\_2 \\leq 1/2\\). Show that
   output levels \\(q\_1,q\_2\\) in equilibrium are determined by

   \\begin{align} \\label{eq:24} 1-2q\_1-q\_2-c\_1 &=0 \\\\
   1-2q\_2-q\_1-c\_2 &=0 \\end{align}

   Solving these equations we find that (you do not need to show this,
   we are telling you this):

   \\begin{align} \\label{eq:25} q\_i &= (1-2c\_i+c\_j)/3 \\\\ \\pi\_i
   &= (1-2c\_i+c\_j)^2/9 \\end{align}

   with \\(i,j \\in \\{1,2\\}, i \\neq j\\).

   (d) [2 points] Show that firm \\(i\\)'s incentive to reduce costs is
   –at the margin– given by

   \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:26} \\frac{\\partial \\pi\_i}{\\partial
   c\_i} = - \\frac{4}{9} (1-2c\_i+c\_j) \\end{equation}

   (e) [5 points] Assume that \\(c\_1 =c\_2=c\\). Compare the incentive
   to reduce \\(c\\) for the monopolist with the incentive for a
   duopolist. Which firm (i.e. monopolist or duopolist) has the bigger
   incentive to reduce \\(c\\)? Why? Discuss your answer in the light of
   the effects of competition on innovation.

   Now assume that there is an incumbent firm with constant marginal
   costs \\(c \\leq 1/2\\) and fixed costs of production \\(f \\in
   \\langle 0,1/16\\rangle\\). A potential has access to the following
   R&D technology. By investing \\(\\phi^2 /2\\), there is a probability
   \\(\\phi\\) that the entrant comes into the market with constant
   marginal costs equal to \\(\\hat c =0\\) (and no fixed costs of
   production).

   In response to this, the incumbent offers customers the following
   contract to be signed now before it is known whether the entrant
   comes into the market. If the entrant does not come into the market,
   the customer buys at a price \\(p=(1+c)/2\\). If the entrant does
   enter, customer can buy from the incumbent at a price \\(p=\\alpha
   c\\) with \\(\\alpha \\in [0,1]\\).

   (f) [5 points] Show that the entrant's profits in the market (if it
   enters) equal \\(\\pi\_e = \\alpha c (1- \\alpha c)\\). Show that
   profits \\(\\pi\_e\\) increase with \\(\\alpha\\).

   (g) [2 points] Suppose that the entrant wants to complain about this
   contract at the European Commission. Which article should it refer to
   and what is the argument?

   (h) [3 points] Which test can be used to argue that the incumbent's
   contract is problematic in case \\(\\alpha=1\\)? And which other test
   in case \\(\\alpha < 1\\)?


.. _Regulation:
   
Regulation
----------

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

-  in the competition policy lectures we analyze how to create the
   "best" interaction between competing firms
-  but what if there is only one firm?

   -  natural monopoly, e.g. because it is too expensive to duplicate
      the infrastructure

      -  two (or more) railway tracks between cities to have competing
         railway companies
      -  two sets of electricity grids around the country

   -  sometimes we don't want choice

      -  a number of companies to run prisons such that criminals choose
         the one they like most
      -  competing companies where you can do your exam to get a driving
         license

-  one option is to let such a firm operate as monopolist
-  such an outcome is usually not favourable for welfare

   -  high prices, deadweight loss, loss in static efficiency
   -  low incentives to improve products and production processes, loss
      in dynamic efficiency

-  government can decide to regulate such a firm

   -  examples of regulated activities include: railway tracks, railway
      companies, postal services, water, gass, electricity, prisons,
      garbage collection

-  even though companies are regulated, there are often many complaints
   about such companies

   -  inefficiencies
   -  high rents (e.g. in the form of high salaries for management)

-  we introduce a model of a regulated firm and show that with
   asymmetric information inefficiencies and rents cannot be avoided

   -  high cost firms tend to be inefficient
   -  low cost firms earn rents

-  to reduce ineffiencies and rents, government may decide to close down
   high cost firms and/or use yardstick competition

Model
~~~~~

-  consider a public project with value \\(S\\) for society
-  project size is fixed (i.e. we do not consider output as a variable;
   project is done or not)
-  regulated firm's cost of doing the project: \\(C=\\beta-e\\)
-  where \\(\\beta\\) is the cost parameter (efficiency) of the firm
-  assume that there two types of firm: \\(\\beta^h,\\beta^l\\) with
   \\(\\beta^h>\\beta^l\\)
-  probability that regulated firm is of type \\(\\beta^l\\) equals
   \\(\\nu \\in \\langle 0,1 \\rangle\\)
-  \\(e\\) denotes effort by management to reduce costs, higher effort
   leads to lower costs
-  cost of effort for management is denoted by \\(\\psi(e)\\) with
   \\(\\psi,\\psi',\\psi^{\\prime\\prime},\\psi^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}>0\\) and \\(\\lim\_{e \\rightarrow
   \\beta} \\psi(e) = +\\infty\\)
-  realized costs \\(C\\) are observable to the regulator
-  payoffs

   -  planner gives firm a transfer \\(T=t+C\\), where \\(t\\) is the
      net transfer (above costs)

      -  with postal services or public transport, \\(T\\) can be chosen
         indirectly via maximum prices that public has to pay

   -  firm's payoffs equal \\(U = t -\\psi(e)\\)
   -  if the firm is closed down or the owner stops operating the firm,
      firm's owner gets outside utility normalized to 0
   -  hence if regulator wants the firm to produce she must ensure \\(U
      \\geq 0\\)
   -  this is called the Individual Rationality (IR) constraint
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:1} \\tag{IR} t-\\psi(e) \\geq 0
      \\end{equation}
   -  when the government has to raise one euro (to pay to the firm)
      this entails costs \\(1+\\lambda>1\\)
   -  the idea is that the regulator uses distortionary taxation to
      raise money, hence the marginal cost of public funds is higher
      than 1
   -  net surplus for society
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:2} S-(1+\\lambda)T =
      S-(1+\\lambda)(t+\\beta -e) \\end{equation}
   -  *TODO* total welfare (sum of society's and firm's payoff) can be
      written as **check**
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:3} W = S-(1+\\lambda)(t+\\beta-e) + U
      = S-(1+\\lambda)(\\beta-e+\\psi(e)) - \\lambda U \\end{equation}
   -  because \\(\\lambda >0\\), regulator dislikes leaving rents
      (\\(U>0\\)) to the firm
   -  regulator makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the firm

-  first best

   -  first assume that there is no asymmeric information: regulator
      observes firm's type \\(\\beta\\)
   -  there is no reason to leave rents to the firm: \\(U=0\\) or
      equivalently \\(t=\\psi(e)\\)
   -  planner chooses effort \\(e\\) to maximize
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:4} S-(1+\\lambda)(\\beta-e+\\psi(e))
      \\end{equation}
   -  *TODO* first best effort \\(e^\*\\) is characterized by **check**
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:5} \\psi'(e^\*) = 1 \\end{equation}
   -  further \\(C^\* = \\beta - e^\*,t=\\psi(e^\*)\\)
   -  there are two ways in which the regulator can implement this:

      -  since \\(C\\) is observable, the manager is punished in case
         \\(C \\neq C^\*\\)
      -  alternatively, \\(T^\* = \\psi(e^\*)+C^\*\\), firm then chooses
         \\(e\\) to maximize
         \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:6} T^\* - (\\beta-e)-\\psi(e)
         \\end{equation}
      -  *TODO* firm chooses \\(e=e^\*\\) **check**
      -  firm is residual claimant: as \\(T\\) does not depend on
         realized costs, every penny saved goes to the firm and firm
         chooses first best effort level

-  second best

   -  asymmetric information: regulator does not observe \\(\\beta\\)
   -  \\(\\beta\\) is private information of the firm
   -  as the planner cannot observe \\(\\beta\\), she offers the firm
      two options \\((t^l,C^l)\\) and \\((t^h,C^h)\\)
   -  these contracts are designed in such a way that each type of firm

      -  is willing to participate (IR)
      -  chooses the contract meant for it: incentive compatibility (IC)

   -  in this way, the firm reveals its type \\(\\beta\\)
   -  we write
      \\begin{align} \\label{eq:7} U^l &= t^l - \\psi(\\beta^l-C^l) \\\\
      U^h &= t^h - \\psi(\\beta^h-C^h) \\end{align}
   -  to make sure each type reveals itself, we have two IC contraints:
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:8} \\tag{$IC\_l$} U^l \\geq t^h
      -\\psi(\\beta^l-C^h)
      \\end{equation}

      \\begin{equation}
      \\tag{$IC\_h$} U^h \\geq t^l
      -\\psi(\\beta^h-C^l) \\end{equation}
   -  if \\(\\beta^h\\) chooses the \\(\\beta^l\\) contract, it gets
      transfer \\(t^l\\) and has to choose effort such that \\(\\beta^h
      - e = C^l\\) because \\(C\\) is observable
   -  effort cost of doing this ("mimicking \\(\\beta^l\\)") equals
      \\(\\psi(\\beta^h-C^l)\\)
   -  *TODO* the first best outcome derived above does not satisfy the IC
      constraints **check**

      -  which type violates IC and why?

   -  *TODO* adding the two IC constraint together yields **check**
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:9} \\tag{addedIC} \\psi(\\beta^l-C^h)
      + \\psi(\\beta^h-C^l) - \\psi(\\beta^l-C^l) - \\psi(\\beta^h-C^h)
      \\geq 0 \\end{equation}
   -  we would like to know how \\(C^h\\) and \\(C^l\\) compare
   -  *TODO* use integration to rewrite the inequaltiy as **check**
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:10} \\int\_{\\beta^l}^{\\beta^h}
      (\\psi'(\\beta-C^l)-\\psi'(\\beta-C^h))d\\beta \\geq 0
      \\end{equation}
   -  *TODO* again using integration, we get **check**
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:11} \\int\_{C^l}^{C^h}
      \\int\_{\\beta^l}^{\\beta^h} \\psi^{\\prime\\prime}(\\beta-C) d\\beta dC \\geq 0
      \\end{equation}
   -  we know that \\(\\beta^h>\\beta^l\\) and \\(\\psi^{\\prime\\prime} > 0\\); hence
      it follows from this inequality that \\(C^h \\geq C^l\\)
   -  \\(C\\) is non-decreasing in type \\(\\beta\\): the less efficient
      the firm, the higher its costs \\(C\\) will be in an incentive
      compatible outcome
   -  put differently, the regulator cannot implement an outcome where
      \\(\\beta^h\\) has lower costs \\(C\\) than \\(\\beta^l\\)
   -  the IR constraints can be written as
      \\begin{align} \\label{eq:12} U^h &\\geq 0 \\\\ U^l &\\geq 0
      \\end{align}
   -  solving the optimization problem for the regulator with 4
      constraints (2 IR and 2 IC constraints) is not "pleasant"
   -  hence we look for ways to simplify the problem:

      -  first, we argue that we can ignore the (\\(IR\_l\\))
         constraint:
      -  *TODO* show that \\(IR\_l\\) is implied by
         \\(IC\_l,\\beta^h>\\beta^l\\) and \\(IR\_h\\) **check**
         \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:13} U\_l \\geq
         t^h-\\psi(\\beta^l-C^h) \\geq t^h - \\psi(\\beta^h-C^h) \\geq 0
         \\end{equation}
      -  second, we "guess" that (\\(IC\_h\\)) is not binding and we
         check afterwards (see below) that this is indeed the case

   -  *TODO* with \\(IC\_l,IR\_h\\) biding, we have **check**

      \\begin{align} \\label{eq:14} t^h &= \\psi(\\beta^h-C^h) \\\\ t^l
      &= t^h - \\psi(\\beta^l-C^h)+\\psi(\\beta^l-C^l) \\\\ &=
      [\\psi(\\beta^h-C^h)-\\psi(\\beta^l-C^h)]+\\psi(\\beta^l-C^l)
      \\end{align}

      or equivalently

      \\begin{align} \\label{eq:15} U^h &= 0 \\\\ U^l &=
      \\psi(\\beta^h-C^h)-\\psi(\\beta^l-C^h) \\end{align}

   -  *TODO* using this, the planner's optimization problem can be written
      as **check**
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:16} \\max\_{C^l,C^h}
      \\nu[S-(1+\\lambda)(C^l+\\psi(\\beta^l-C^l))-\\lambda(\\psi(\\beta^h-C^h)-\\psi(\\beta^l-C^h))
      ] + (1-\\nu)[S-(1+\\lambda)(C^h+\\psi(\\beta^h-C^h)) ]
      \\end{equation}
   -  *TODO* the first order conditions for \\(C^l,C^h\\) can be written
      as **check**
      \\begin{align} \\label{eq:17} \\psi'(\\beta^l-C^l) &= 1 \\\\
      \\psi'(\\beta^h-C^h) &= 1 - \\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}
      \\frac{\\lambda}{1+\\lambda}(\\psi'(\\beta^h-C^h)-\\psi'(\\beta^l-C^h)
      ) \\end{align}
   -  hence we find that the low cost type \\(\\beta^l\\) chooses first
      best effort: \\(e^l = \\beta^l -C^l = e^\*\\)
   -  however, \\(\\psi'(\\beta^h-C^h)<1\\) implies that \\(e^h =
      \\beta^h-C^h < e^\*\\): the high cost type \\(\\beta^h\\)
      underinvests in effort
   -  put differently,

      -  \\(\\beta^l\\) chooses efficient effort \\(e^l=e^\*\\) and
         receives a positive rent: \\(t^l > \\psi(e^l)\\) or
         equivalently \\(U^l > 0\\)
      -  \\(\\beta^h\\) chooses inefficiently low effort \\(e^l <
         e^\*\\) and receives zero rents: \\(U^h =0\\)

   -  the intuition for this is as follows:

      -  \\(\\beta^l\\) can always mimic \\(\\beta^h\\) and do better
         because \\(\\beta^l<\\beta^h\\)
      -  hence \\(\\beta^l\\) can make a profit (as long as
         \\(\\beta^h\\) is active: see below)
      -  to reduce this profit, the regulator distorts \\(\\beta^h\\)'s
         effort downwards
      -  *TODO* the lower \\(e^h\\), the lower the rent that the regulator
         has to pay \\(\\beta^l\\) **check**

   -  we assumed (or "guessed") above that \\(IC\_h\\) is satisfied,
      now we need to verify that this is indeed the case in our solution

      -  *TODO* in our solution, we can write \\(IC\_h\\) as **check**
         \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:18} 0 \\geq
         \\psi(\\beta^h-C^h)-\\psi(\\beta^l-C^h)+\\psi(\\beta^l-C^l)-\\psi(\\beta^h-C^l)
         \\end{equation}
      -  *TODO* this inequality is implied by equation (addedIC) **check**

-  shutdown of \\(\\beta^h\\) firm

   -  in the solution above, the regulator has to pay rents to the
      \\(\\beta^l\\) type firm
   -  these rents are costly as \\(\\lambda>0\\)
   -  as an alternative, the planner can make \\(IR\_l\\) binding, but
      then \\(\\beta^h\\) firm has to close down (cannot profitably
      participate)
   -  can this be optimal for the regulator?
   -  to find out, we compare the benefits and costs of closing down the
      \\(\\beta^h\\) firm:

      -  *TODO* by shutting down \\(\\beta^h\\), the regulator saves in
         rents: **check**
         \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:19} \\nu \\lambda
         (\\psi(\\beta^h-C^h)-\\psi(\\beta^l-C^h) ) \\end{equation}
      -  *TODO* on the cost side, shutting down \\(\\beta^h\\) leads to
         loss of surplus equal to **check**
         \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:20} (1-\\nu)
         (S-(1+\\lambda)[\\beta^h-e^h+\\psi(\\beta^h-C^h)]
         \\end{equation}

   -  for \\(\\nu,\\lambda\\) high enough and \\(S\\) low enough, the
      benefits of closing down \\(\\beta^h\\) exceed the costs (in terms
      of lost surplus)
   -  hence it can be optimal for the regulator to close down an
      inefficient firm, although the firm itself still produces a
      positive surplus

-  yardstick competition

   -  sometimes it is possible to have two (or more) regulated firms,
      each with a monopoly in their own region

      -  two railway companies operating in different regions
      -  two prisons in different regions
      -  garbage collection done by different firms in different cities

   -  the question is: should the contract for public good provider
      \\(P\_1\\) depend on the performance of \\(P\_2\\) (and the other
      way around)?
   -  this is called yardstick competition or relative performance
      evaluation
   -  in order to analyze this in the framework above, we assume that
      \\(C^i = \\beta^a + \\beta^i - e^i\\) where

      -  \\(\\beta^a\\) denotes the aggregate shock which is the same
         for both providers \\(P\_1,P\_2\\)
      -  \\(\\beta^i\\) denotes the idiosyncratic shock for provider
         \\(P\_i\\)

   -  if we assume that \\(\\beta^a \\equiv 0\\), we are back to the
      model above

      -  since the performance of \\(P\_i\\) does not provide
         information about \\(P\_j\\)'s type, nothing can be gained from
         yardstick competition

   -  if we assume that \\(\\beta^i \\equiv 0\\), yardstick competition
      can implement first best

      -  if the regulator does not understand the nature of
         \\(\\beta^a\\), she may treat each firm independently
      -  in this case, we get the same outcome as above: either
         \\(\\beta^h\\) is closed down or there are positive rents for
         \\(\\beta^l\\) and inefficient low effort for \\(\\beta^h\\)

   -  if the regulator does understand the nature of \\(\\beta^a\\), she
      offers \\(P\_i\\) the following contract:
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:21} t^i = \\psi(e^\*) - (C^i - C^j)
      \\end{equation}
   -  that is, \\(P\_i\\) gets higher transfer if it outperforms
      \\(P\_j\\): \\(C^i < C^j\\): yardstick competition
   -  \\(P\_i\\) solves
      \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:22} \\max\_e \\{\\psi(e^\*)-
      [(\\beta^a - e)-(\\beta^a - e^j) ] -\\psi(e) \\} \\end{equation}
   -  *TODO* \\(P\_i\\) chooses \\(e^i = e^\*\\): first best
      effort **check**
   -  *TODO* \\(U^i = t^i - \\psi(e^i) = 0\\) in equilibrium **check**
   -  hence with yardstick competition and aggregate shocks only,
      regulator implements first best effort with zero rents
   -  relative performance evaluation (\\(t^i\\) depends on \\(C^j\\))
      filters out the asymmetric information on \\(\\beta^a\\)
   -  if both \\(\\beta^a,\\beta^i \\neq 0\\) then yardstick competition
      does not implement first best, but does improve on a mechanism
      where \\(t^i\\) can only depend on \\(C^i\\)

-  Policy implications

   -  in some markets competition is either not feasible or not
      desirable
   -  firm is a monopolist
   -  government can decide to regulate the monopolist
   -  if there is no asymmetric information, government can implement
      first best outcome

      -  firm earns no rents
      -  firm invests the efficient level of effort

   -  with asymmetric information, high cost type chooses inefficiently
      low effort and low cost type earns positive rents
   -  to reduce the low type's rents and raise high type's efficiency,
      yardstick competition can be used if firms' costs have a common
      component

-  In the interactive lecture we can go over the *TODO*'s above which you
   cannot figure out yourself
-  question 1: graphical version of this lecture

   Whereas the lecture on this topic considered the "calculus
   approach", here we focus on the graphical presentation of this
   problem. For the exam you need to be able to understand both these
   approaches.

   We consider the same set-up as in the lecture. There is a public
   project with value \\(S\\) to society. There is one firm, the
   monopolist, who can do this project at cost \\(C=\\beta-e\\).
   \\(\\beta \\in \\{\\beta^l,\\beta^h\\}\\) is the type of the firm
   with \\(\\beta^h > \\beta^l >0\\) and \\(e\\) denotes the firm's
   effort to reduce production costs. The cost of effort is denoted by
   \\(\\psi(e)\\) with \\(\\psi,\\psi',\\psi^{\\prime\\prime}>0\\) for \\(e>0\\).
   Planner pays the firm a transfer \\(T = t+C\\) where \\(t\\) denotes
   the transfer net of costs. Cost for the planner to raise \\(T\\)
   equals \\((1+\\lambda)T\\) with \\(\\lambda \\geq 0\\).

   Payoff to the firm equals \\(u = t - \\psi(e)\\). If the firm does
   not produce, it gets an outside utility equal to 0.

   The figure shows indifference curves in \\(C,t\\)-space: \\(u^l=0\\)
   for the \\(\\beta^l\\) type and \\(u^h=0\\) for the \\(\\beta^h\\)
   type. Further, it shows the first best contracts: \\(\\alpha\\) for
   the low type and \\(\\beta\\) for the high type.

|fig1|

   (a) [5 points] Why is the \\(u^h =0\\) line steeper than the
   \\(u^l=0\\) line for each \\(C\\)? Why is \\(C\\) in contract
   \\(\\alpha\\) lower than \\(C\\) in contract \\(\\beta\\)?

   (b) [5 points] Derive the slope of the relevant indifference curve at
   contract \\(\\alpha\\) and at \\(\\beta\\)?

   From now on we assume that the planner cannot observe
   \\(\\beta^l,\\beta^h\\). That is, the firm's type is private
   information: known to the firm but not to the planner.

   (c) [5 points] Use the figure to argue that the contracts
   \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) cannot be implemented in case of asymmetric
   information about firm's type.

   (d) [5 points] Suppose that the planner wants to implement first best
   effort levels. Redraw the figure with two contracts that feature (i)
   first best effort for each type and (ii) incentive compatibility
   (with lowest possible rents). Draw for each type the indifference
   curve through its contract.

   (e) [5 points] For which value of \\(\\lambda \\geq 0\\) is the
   outcome under (d) optimal for the planner? What is the problem if
   \\(\\lambda\\) is higher than this value?

   From now on, we assume that \\(\\lambda\\) is too high to make it
   optimal for the planner to implement the first best effort levels for
   each type.

   (f) [5 points] Use the figure to illustrate the trade off that the
   planner faces.

   (g) [5 points] Redraw the figure with first best contracts and
   indicate where the optimal contracts for the planner are under
   asymmetric information (second best). [hint: you do not have enough
   information to pinpoint the position of the second best contracts
   exactly. But qualitatively you can point out where they are.]

   (h) [5 points] Which incentive compatibility constraints and which
   individual rationality constraints are binding in the optimal (second
   best) outcome?

   (i) [10 points] Assume that the probability (\\(\\nu\\)) that the
   firm is the low type increases. Using the figure (or otherwise)
   explain how the optimal (second best) contracts change in response to
   this increase in \\(\\nu\\). Explain why the optimal contracts change
   in this way.

Competition policy in health care
---------------------------------

Should we allow an insurer to merge with a provider?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Introduction

   -  In the Netherlands there is a debate whether an insurer should be
      allowed to take over a provider, like a hospital
   -  Some people think this is highly problematic and should therefore
      be forbidden
   -  Others believe such integration of insurers and providers is a
      good thing as coordination is easier within a firm than between
      firms
   -  Some go even further: why not integrate insurer, hospital, primary
      physician, physiotherapist etc.
   -  Then there is coordination not only between insurer and provider
      but also between different providers
   -  We will consider the pros and cons of integration

-  Why integration should be abolished

   -  If an insurer integrates with a provider, this provider is no
      longer available for patients at other insurers (foreclosure)
   -  or the provider is available for other insurers at a higher
      price/lower quality (partial foreclosure)
   -  This is problematic for people living close to a hospital who have
      another insurer
   -  Integration increases market power of insurers and leads to higher
      prices for health insurance
   -  Integration makes it harder for other providers or insurers to
      enter the market

-  Why integration is a good thing

   -  Integration makes health care cheaper: without integration, a
      provider sells treatments to the insurer at prices above costs
      (otherwise it cannot cover its fixed costs) and the insurer sells
      to consumers at prices above the (expected) treatment prices
      (otherwise insurer cannot cover fixed costs): double
      marginalization
   -  After integration the insurer has a bigger incentive to invest in
      the hospital

      -  free riding is reduced: when an insurer invests in a provider,
         other insurers do not benefit
      -  hold up is reduced: after integration, insurer investing in a
         hospital does not need to worry that hospital gets (some of)
         the rents

-  Why these arguments are "inaccurate"

   -  Why does integration lead to more market power and foreclosure?
   -  Double marginalization can also be solved using two part tariffs;
      why do we need integration to solve this?
   -  Why can't contracts protect specific investments?

-  Vertical integration and other restraints

   -  | Intra-brand competition

      The models discussed on :ref:`intra-brand competition <intra>` can be
      applied here as well: provider is upstream firm and insurer is
      downstream.

      Then analysis in competition policy lecture (on double
      marginalization, foreclosure etc.) applies here as well.

      So here we focus on the investment incentives

-  Investments

   -  Two arguments why integration may help to stimulate investments
   -  hold up: suppose insurer can invest \\(x\\) to increase value
      \\(V(x)\\) of his cooperation with provider \\(P\\) (say, to
      reduce cost \\(c\\)) with \\(V' >0, V^{\\prime\\prime} <0\\)
   -  After the investment, \\(I\\) and \\(P\\) bargain about the
      distribution of the value \\(V(x)\\); part \\(\\beta < 1\\) goes
      to \\(I\\) and \\((1-\\beta)\\) to \\(P\\) (e.g. \\(\\beta =
      0.5\\))
   -  Then \\(I\\) chooses \\(x\\) to solve \\(\\max\_x \\beta V(x) -
      x\\)
   -  First order condition: \\(\\beta V'(x) =1\\)
   -  \\(I\\) underinvests in \\(x\\) because he has to share the
      returns with \\(P\\)
   -  Put differently, there is positive external effect from \\(I\\)'s
      investment on \\(P\\) that leads to underinvestment
   -  After integration, \\(I\\) and \\(P\\) solve \\(\\max\_x V(x) -
      x\\), hence investments go up after integration because all
      effects are internalized by \\(I\\) and \\(P\\)
   -  free riding: Suppose \\(I\_1\\) can invest in \\(P\\) to raise its
      demand \\(p(q,x)\\) with \\(p\_x >0\\) (or reduce costs
      \\(\\gamma(x)\\) with \\(\\gamma\_x <0\\)).
   -  Think of software to guide patients through a decision process of
      what type of treatment they want
   -  However, \\(P\\) can also use this software for patients from
      \\(I\_2\\)
   -  Such free riding by \\(I\_2\\) on \\(I\_1\\)'s investment reduces
      \\(I\_1\\)'s incentive to invest:

      -  low costs \\(\\gamma\\) are especially profitable, if you are
         the only one with such low costs
      -  service \\(x\\) is especially attractive for customers
         (\\(p\_x\\) is high) if \\(I\_1\\) is the only one offering
         this service

   -  Integration helps to remove free riding. The combination \\(P\\)
      and \\(I\_1\\) will not let customers from \\(I\_2\\) use this
      investment (or \\(I\_2\\)'s customers can benefit from investment
      \\(x\\) through higher price)
   -  Hence integration stimulates investment also in the case of free
      riding.
   -  Assumptions needed to make sense of this:

      -  \\(P\\) cannot invest itself (e.g. cash constraint)
      -  \\(I\_1\\) cannot write a contract to appropriate the returns
         from the investment (e.g. to exclude \\(I\_2\\) from using the
         investment)

-  Policy implications

   -  It is not obvious that vertical integration between insurer and
      provider is bad for welfare (Chicago school arguments)
   -  It can reduce prices in case of double marginalization (but two
      part tariffs can do the same)
   -  However, if providers cannot commit to contracts, they cannot
      generate monopoly profits and prices will be lower (Hart and
      Tirole)
   -  In that case vertical integration can help to raise prices
   -  Other insurers are (partially) foreclosed
   -  Integration may help to stimulate investments (in case of hold up
      and free riding)

Health insurance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Dutch health insurance

   -  In the Netherlands, mandatory basic health insurance is offered by
      private insurance companies
   -  However, the market is heavily regulated
   -  The ZVW (Dutch law on basic health insurance) has 3 complementary
      articles on solidarity

      -  mandatory insurance for citizen
      -  mandatory acceptance by insurers
      -  no premium differentiation nor risk selection

   -  Without the articles the market will fail
   -  Risk adjustment is one of the instruments used by the government
      to improve outcomes on the health insurance market

-  Competition in health insurance

   -  adverse selection and the risk that the market "disappears"
   -  market is not able to generate an efficient outcome
   -  theory predicts that high (expected cost) types get the best
      insurance
   -  low (expected cost) types cannot get full insurance at actuarialy
      fair price
   -  solidarity would imply that both types get the same contract and
      share the costs: the market cannot generate this outcome
   -  assume that there are two types of consumers: expected costs
      \\(\\theta^h > \\theta^l\\)
   -  insurance contracts cover a fraction \\(q\\) of the expected costs
      of the insured at a price (premium) \\(p\\)
   -  Market competition (`Rothschild and Stiglitz,
      1976 <http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1885326?uid=3738736&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21103114791631>`__)
      forces insurance profits equal to zero: \\(p=q \\theta\\)
   -  the figure below shows indifference curves for both \\(\\theta\\)
      types

|fig2|

   -  Indifference curves are upward sloping: as coverage \\(q\\) goes
      up, consumers are willing to pay a higher \\(p\\) (and keep the
      same utility)
   -  Indifference curve is steeper for high type as the same increase
      in \\(q\\) has a bigger effect on expected costs
   -  | the figure gives three zero-profit lines: first,

      \\begin{equation\*} p= \\theta^h q \\end{equation\*}

      for high types and, second, similarly \\(p = \\theta^l q\\) for
      low types

   -  | Thirdly, if both types choose the same (pooling) contract:

      \\begin{equation\*} p = (\\lambda \\theta^h +(1-\\lambda)
      \\theta^l)q \\end{equation\*}

      where \\(\\lambda\\) is the fraction of high types

   -  Solidarity would suggest the pooling contract
   -  Suppose an insurance company offers the pooling contract at price
      \\(p = (\\lambda \\theta^h +(1-\\lambda) \\theta^l)q\\)
   -  Then another company enters with a contract with slightly lower
      \\(q\\) and \\(p \\in \\langle \\theta^l q, (\\lambda \\theta^h
      +(1-\\lambda) \\theta^l)q \\rangle\\)
   -  low types prefer this contract because they no longer need to pay
      for the high types
   -  The new company makes strictly positive profits as \\(p >
      \\theta^l q\\)
   -  The pooling contract makes a loss as \\(p = (\\lambda \\theta^h
      +(1-\\lambda) \\theta^l)q\\) while only high types buy this
      contract
   -  Hence the market "destroys" solidarity in health insurance
   -  The only market outcome is contract \\(A\\) for low types and
      \\(B\\) for high types
   -  both contracts lie on their resp. zero-profit lines
   -  The high type is (just) unwilling to switch to the \\(A\\)
      contract, the low type is not (at all) interested in the \\(B\\)
      contract
   -  High cost types have full insurance \\(q^B =1\\), but low types
      have less than full insurance \\(q^A <1\\)
   -  This is inefficient as low types are risk averse and would like to
      have full insurance
   -  They cannot both have full insurance (as the pooling contract is
      not a market outcome)
   -  low type gets the maximum insurance that leaves high type
      indifferent between switching to cheaper contract
   -  for \\(\\lambda\\) low enough (as in the figure) this (only)
      market outcome can be broken as well:
   -  a new firm offers contract \\(C\\) which is attractive to both
      types at a price \\(p > (\\lambda \\theta^h +(1-\\lambda)
      \\theta^l)q\\).
   -  This is a profitable contract. In this case there is no market
      equilibrium at all!
   -  Disadvantages of the (perfectly competitive) market: outcome may
      be very unstable (as equilibrium may not exist), low types are not
      fully insured, there is no "solidarity contract"

-  Welfare loss

   -  The only inefficiency in the model above is that healthy people do
      not get full insurance
   -  From a solidarity point of view one can worry about the expensive
      insurance for unhealthy types
   -  In the model, there is no income
   -  In reality, income and health are positively correlated, hence
      unhealthy people may not be able to afford (expensive) health
      insurance (situation in the US before Obamacare)
   -  Although in the model above, insurers cannot contract directly on
      people's health (they cannot refuse someone who they know is going
      to be expensive), they do manage to separate the different types
   -  This separation leads to inefficiency \\(q^l <1\\)

-  How can regulation improve outcome in health insurance market?

   -  These market failures for health insurance justify –from a
      theoretical point of view– government intervention
   -  Reduce incentives for insurance companies to select good types
   -  in the Netherlands we have done this by forcing insurance
      companies to accept every customer for basic insurance
   -  and risk adjustment fund compensates insurance companies if they
      attract relatively many expensive types
   -  this takes the form of ex ante risk adjustment
   -  based on an insured observable characteristics (age, chronic
      disease, social economic status etc.), the insurer gets money out
      of the fund

      -  to illustrate, an insurer gets relatively little for a young
         insured male without chronic disease and relatively a lot for
         an old person with diabetes

   -  If risk adjustment fully compensates the cost differences between
      types, no reason for insurers to separate types and the outcome is
      fully efficient
   -  in terms of the figure, risk adjustment rotates the
      \\(\\theta^l\\) curve upwards and the \\(\\theta^h\\) curve
      downwards
   -  hence –if an equilibrium exists– it features less distortion:
      \\(q^l\\) increases with risk adjustment
   -  In the Netherlands, the government also uses ex post risk
      adjustment (based on an insurer's realized costs)
   -  From a regulation point of view, this is a bit worrying
   -  Because this adjustment is based on realized costs, it reduces
      incentives to increase efficiency: part of your increased costs
      you get reimbursed anyway!

-  Policy implications

   -  Competition in health insurance markets does not necessarily lead
      to efficient outcomes due to asymmetric information
   -  Insurers try to select risks by offering inefficiently low
      coverage for healthy people
   -  Contracts for unhealthy people do offer full coverage but are very
      expensive; the market cannot implement a pooling equilibrium
   -  The government can improve efficiency by using ex ante risk
      adjustment:

      -  reduces price for high cost types and raises efficiency for low
         cost types

-  question 1 [30 points] Health care

   Consider the situation of one provider \\(P\\) and one insurer
   \\(I\\). The insurer faces a demand for health insurance of the form
   \\(q= 1-\\sigma\\) where \\(\\sigma>0\\) denotes the premium for the
   insurance contract. For simplicity, there is no copayment nor
   deductible if an insured needs treatment. The probability that an
   insured needs treatment is given by \\(\\theta \\in \\langle 0,1
   \\rangle\\). A patient can only be treated by \\(P\\) is she is
   insured.

   The provider charges a price \\(w\\) for each insured that is treated
   by \\(P\\). The cost of treatment for the provider equals \\(c\\).

   (a) [5 points] Show that –given \\(w\\)– the profit maximizing
   premium is given by \\(\\sigma = (1+\\theta w)/2\\) and the number of
   people buying insurance is given by \\(q = (1-\\theta w)/2\\).

   (b) [5 points] Show that the provider chooses \\(w\\) to solve 
   \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:27} \\max\_w \\theta\\frac{1-\\theta
   w}{2}(w-c) \\end{equation}
   Show that \\(P\\) sets \\(w = (1/\\theta + c)/2\\) and hence
   \\(\\sigma = (3+\\theta c)/4\\).

   (c) [5 points] The insurer and provider want to vertically integrate.
   What will be the insurance premium \\(\\sigma\\) after integration?
   How does this compare to the answer under (b)? What is the intuition
   for this comparison?

   (d) [5 points] The insurer and provider argue that their vertical
   merger increases welfare. Is this true? If so, is this a sound
   argument for integration?

   Now assume a new provider \\(P\_e\\) wants to enter the market. This
   entrant has treatment costs \\(c\_e < c\\). \\(P\\) gives \\(I\\) a
   contract that specifies that \\(I\\) contracts only with \\(P\\) next
   period. If \\(I\\) decides to send some insured patients to
   \\(P\_e\\), it has to pay \\(P\\) a penalty \\(d>0\\).

   (e) [2 points] If \\(P\_e\\) wants to go to the European commission
   to complain about \\(P\\)'s contract, which article of the treaty is
   relevant here? What would be the probalem with \\(P\\)'s contract?

   (f) [3 points] Give the Chicago school argument why \\(P\\)'s
   contract is not welfare reducing.

   (g) [5 points] Sketch a model (no need to solve the model) which
   argues that \\(P\\)'s contract does reduce welfare.
