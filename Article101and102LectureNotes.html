<div class="section" id="model-of-collusion">
<h3>Model of Collusion<a class="headerlink" href="#model-of-collusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Consider \(n\) firms that produce a homogenous good at constant
marginal cost \(c\)</p></li>
<li><p>Demand for the good is given by \(p=1-(q_1 + q_2 + \cdots +
q_n)\)</p></li>
<li><p>Hence a monopolist would produce output \(q^m\) that solves
\begin{equation*} \max_q (1-q-c)q \end{equation*}</p></li>
<li><p>\(q^m = (1-c)/2\) and profits equal \((1-c)^2/4\)</p></li>
<li><p>With Bertrand competition \(p=c\) and firms’ profits equal zero</p></li>
<li><p>If firms collude, charge the monopoly price and share the market
equally each firm produces \(q^{Collusion}=\frac{1-c}{2n}\) and
earns profits equal to \(\frac{(1-c)^2}{4n}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Is such collusion sustainable?</p></li>
<li><p>Incentive Compatibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Suppose the game is repeated over time and firms agree to charge
the monopoly price</p></li>
<li><p>Further, they agree that if one firm deviates by charging a lower
price, they will all play the Bertrand Nash equilibrium from then
onwards</p></li>
<li><p>If a firm sticks to the collusive outcome (and all others do so as
well), the expected discounted profits equal
\(\frac{(1-c)^2}{4n}
(1+\delta+\delta^2+\cdots)=\frac{(1-c)^2}{4n}\frac{1}{1-\delta}\)</p></li>
<li><p>where \(\delta\) equals the discount factor</p></li>
<li><p>If a firm decides to deviate, it is optimal to charge a price
slightly below the monopoly price; because goods are perfect
substitutes all consumers will buy from this deviating firm</p></li>
<li><p>Hence in the deviating period, the deviating firm earns (almost)
the monopoly profit but from then on profits are zero as the firm
is punished by the other firms for its deviation</p></li>
<li><p>Collusion is IC if \(\frac{(1-c)^2}{4n}\frac{1}{1-\delta}
\geq (1-c)^2/4\) or equivalently</p></li>
<li><p>\(n \leq \frac{1}{1-\delta}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Hence the number of firms in the market should be limited (\(n\)
small) and firms should be patient enough (\(\delta\) close
enough to 1)</p></li>
</ul>

<span id="collusion"></span><h3>Factors facilitating collusion<a class="headerlink" href="#factors-facilitating-collusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>high concentration in the industry implies low \(n\) and makes
collusion more likely</p></li>
<li><p>it is hard to enter the industry: if entry is simple and cheap,
colluding on a high price will only attract more firms into the
industry diluting the benefits of collusion</p></li>
<li><p>cross ownership: if firm \(i\) owns part of firm \(j\), then
deviating increases \(i\)’s profits but reduces the pay offs from
its shares in firm \(j\); thus firms less likely to deviate from
collusive agreement if there are cross ownership relations</p></li>
<li><p>Orders arrive with high frequency: if the next order is only expected
in 5 years time, punishment will not be effective if someone deviates
today</p></li>
<li><p>low concentration in buyer market: if there is a single powerful
buyer, she can break the collusion by going to one seller, buying all
goods from him if he lowers his price and threatening to go to
another seller to offer this deal</p></li>
<li><p>stable demand: if demand fluctuates over time (with booms and busts)
collusion will break down:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rotemberg and Saloner (AER, 1986): collusion breaks down in booms:
by deviating in boom earn monopoly profits when demand is high
while you are punished at demand levels which are on average lower</p></li>
<li><p>Green and Porter (Ectra, 1984) collusion breaks (temporarily) down
in busts: firms cannot perfectly observe market demand and other
firms’ prices: hence when demand for firm \(i\)’s products is
low this may be due to a bust or due to another firm deviating
from collusion; to keep collusion IC firms have to punish in case
of low demand for their products</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Homogenous goods and symmetric firms make it easy to coordinate on
the collusive price: in this sense these factors facilitate collusion</p></li>
<li><p>Multi market contacts: it is easier to collude with firm \(j\) in a
certain market if you can punish \(j\) in case of deviation not
only in this market but also in other markets</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent that excess capacity is needed to be able to punish
deviating firms, excess capacity facilitates collusion (on the other
hand, however, excess capacity makes it more attractive to deviate as
well)</p></li>
<li><p>Transparency: the more easy it is for firms to see what their
competitors are doing, the sooner they can punish in case of a
deviation; colluding firms will try to exchange information about
their prices and production to sustain collusion; trade associations
are ideal ways for organizing such exchange of information</p></li>
<li><p>Information exchange also helps in coordinating on the collusive
price</p></li>
<li><p>where the producer of, say, books prints the price on the book itself
increases transparency about prices and hence facilitates collusion</p></li>
<li><p>Symmetric firms facilitate collusion</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Motta (pp. 147) discusses the idea that more symmetric firms can
punish more effectively and hence symmetry facilitates collusion</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, fighting your opponents makes sense if the
differences between you and your opponents is big</p></li>
<li><p>if differences are small, you better behave in a less aggressive
way (collude)</p></li>
<li><p>Chris Froome attacks in mountain stages and time trials where
differences are big</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the model above with \(p=1-(q_1+q_2),c_1 =0,
c_2=c\)</p></li>
<li><p>if \(c=0\) it is optimal to collude with firm 2, as getting rid
of firm 2 requires \(p=c=0\) which yields firm 1 zero profits</p></li>
<li><p>but if \(c=0.4\) and firms cannot collude on market shares (only
on price), the highest profit collusion can give firm 1 equals
\((1-\textstyle{1\over 2})\textstyle{1\over 4}=1/8\)</p></li>
<li><p>setting the limit price \(p=c=0.4\) yields profits
\(0.4*0.6=0.24 &gt; 1/8\)</p></li>
<li><p>hence the more \(c_1\) and \(c_2&gt;c_1\) differ, the more
profitable it is for firm 1 to price aggressively to keep 2 out of
the market</p></li>

<h3>What can government do to prevent collusion?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-can-government-do-to-prevent-collusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If firms play it cleverly, it is hard to prove that firms collude</p></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Therefore it is better to avoid collusion in the first place:</dt><dd><ul>
<li><p>Abolish cross share holdings among competitors</p></li>
<li><p>Abolish institutions (like trade associations) that help firms
exchange information about output and prices</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p>Use dawn raids to (threaten to) find hard evidence of agreements</p></li>
<li><p>Leniency programmes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The idea of a leniency programme is to make it easier (more
profitable) for a firm to go to the CA and admit it is part of a
cartel</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, ex ante, the cartel is less stable and fewer cartels
will form in the first place</p></li>
<li><p>The first firm to go to the CA (before an investigation has
started) and cooperates fully with the CA usually gets full
leniency: this firm pays no fine at all, although it participated
in an illegal cartel</p></li>
<li><p>Once an investigation is under way and a firm volunteers
information to the CA that is useful, it may get a reduction in
its fine (though, usually, not a full reduction)</p></li>
<li><p>Leniency programme makes it harder to satisfy IC constraint for
firms</p></li>
<li><p>to make this even harder to satisfy, one could offer positive
rewards for information on cartels (instead of only a reduction in
fine)</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, instead of giving the reward to a firm, you could
also think about giving the money to the person (whistle blower)
that comes forward with the information</p></li>
<li><p>a reward of Euro 10 million is not much incentive for a firm but a
big incentive for an individual</p></li>
<li><p>The idea here is not so much to reward but to prevent the cartel
from forming in the first place</p></li>
<li><p>To further discourage cartels from forming, the law could allow
(as in the US) that managers end up in jail if they participate in
a cartel</p></li>

<div class="section" id="other-horizontal-agreements">
<h3>Other horizontal agreements<a class="headerlink" href="#other-horizontal-agreements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Joint-Ventures</p></li>
<li><p>Cross-Licensing and Patent Pooling</p></li>
<li><p>Cooperative Standard-Setting</p></li>
<li><p>trade off between potential anti-competitive concerns against
likelihood of efficiency benefits</p></li>
<li><p>note that joint ventures that perform on a lasting basis the
functions of an autonomous entity fall under the Merger Regulation</p></li>
<li><p>see Motta section 4.5</p></li>
<li><p>Pro or anti competitive?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A joint venture can be a way for firms to share information such
that colluding becomes easier.</p></li>
<li><p>The question to ask is whether without the agreement there would
be more or less competition</p></li>
<li><p>In Ford/Volkswagen the Commission claimed that the co-operation
between Ford and Volkswagen did not reduce competition in the
segment of multi-purpose vehicles because neither producer was
(nor would be) active in this segment without this co-operation</p></li>
<li><p>Without cooperation there would be less choice in multi-purpose
vehicle segment, therefore co-operation was allowed though it may
have helped Ford and Volkswagen to coordinate production in this
segment as well.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Licensing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A license is the property of the firm that owns it; hence a firm
can refuse to license its intellectual property</p></li>
<li><p>This is fine, unless one can claim it is an <em>essential facility</em></p></li>
<li><p>If a license is granted to another firm, there may be a concern
with the terms of the license.</p></li>
<li><p>Principle is: what would happen without such terms in the license?</p></li>
<li><p>If firm is not allowed to use such terms in license agreement and
then decides not to grant license at all, it is probably better to
allow these terms</p></li>
<li><p>If the terms are restricting competition and the firm would also
grant the license without such terms, the terms should not be
allowed.</p></li>

</ul>

<div class="section" id="vertical-restraints">
<h3>Vertical Restraints<a class="headerlink" href="#vertical-restraints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Distinction intra-brand and inter-brand competition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intra: competition between retailers selling the same
product/brand</p></li>
<li><p>Inter: competition between manufacturers selling different
products/brands through retailers</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>General principle: if there is enough inter-brand competition, we do
not worry (too much) about vertical restraints;</p></li>
<li><p>if inter-brand competition is limited, vertical agreements become
more suspicious</p></li>
<li><p>But even then, we need to consider on a case by case basis what the
effect of the vertical restraint is</p></li>
<li><p>to illustrate, we consider some of the vertical restraints mentioned
above</p></li>
<li><p>Selective Distribution</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Manufacturer sells products to limited number of retailers</p></li>
<li><p>This can be bad for welfare for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this reduces competition between retailers for this brand</p></li>
<li><p>therefore it allows the manufacturer to commit to high prices</p></li>
<li><p>if reaction functions slope upward, competitors also raise
price</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>This can be welfare enhancing for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>some retailers have staff trained to give pre-sales service
(e.g. advice) in shop</p></li>
<li><p>other retailers (e.g. “kijkshop” or a webshop) may free ride on
this, such that consumers get advice in one shop and then buy
the product more cheaply in the kijkshop or on the web</p></li>
<li><p>this free riding reduces the incentive of retailers to invest
in pre-sales service</p></li>
<li><p>if manufacturer finds this service important, selective
distribution can be used to reduce the free riding</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Exclusive dealership</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can be done explicitly through contract or implicitly</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unilever supplied freezers to retailers with the condition that
in these freezers only Unilever brands could be stored</p></li>
<li><p>Since most retailers have at max. one freezer, this leads to a
<em>de facto</em> exclusive dealership</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>This can be bad for welfare for the following reason</p>
<ul>
<li><p>removes all other brands from the shop and hence reduces
inter-brand competition within the shop</p></li>
<li><p>if the number of retailers is limited, exclusive dealership may
make entry by new firms very costly or even impossible as they
cannot find retailers that can sell their products to final
consumers (foreclosure)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>This can be welfare enhancing for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>manufacturer may want to invest in training of retailer staff</p></li>
<li><p>This knowledge may also be useful for the staff when selling
products from other manufacturers</p></li>
<li><p>exclusive dealership raises the return to training for the
manufacturer</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Resale Price Maintenance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This can be bad for welfare for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>By fixing the price for the retailer, it becomes easier for
manufacturers to collude</p></li>
<li><p>without RPM, a low price for a product at a certain retail
outlet could be either due to a defection by the manufacturer
or a fall in demand for this product in the area where this
retailer operates</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>This can be welfare enhancing for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it can help to solve the double marginalization problem</p></li>
<li><p>Consider manufacturer and retailer which are both monopolists
on their market; both produce with zero marginal costs; demand
for manufacturer’s product is given by \(p(q)=1-q\). Let
\(w\) denote wholesale price at which manufacturer sells to
retailer</p></li>
<li><p>Given \(w\), retailer chooses output level that maximizes
\(q(1-q-w)\); hence we get \(q(w) = \textstyle{1\over 2}
(1-w)\)</p></li>
<li><p>manufacturer chooses \(w\) to maximize \(w
\textstyle{1\over 2} (1-w)\); thus \(w=\textstyle{1\over
2}\) and \(q(w) = \textstyle{1\over 4}\) which is lower
than overall monopoly output which equals
\(\textstyle{1\over 2}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Hence if manufacturer directly determines the price using RPM,
it chooses \(p = q =\textstyle{1\over 2}\), the retailer
pays a franchise fee and both the firms and consumers are
better off</p></li>

<h3>Position taken by European Commission<a class="headerlink" href="#position-taken-by-european-commission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Commission distinguishes hard-core vertical restraints which are
presumed illegal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an example here is RPM, but as we saw above RPM can be welfare
enhancing</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Vertical relations between \(U\) pstream and \(D\) ownstream
firms (e.g. manufacturer and retailer) can involve externalities</p></li>
<li><p>Contracts can then be used to internalize these externalities</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the situation this can be either welfare enhancing or
welfare reducing; in principle such vertical contracts must be
allowed in the former case and abolished in the latter</p></li>
<li><p>Principle again is: only worry about these contracts if there is a
lack of inter-brand competition</p></li>
<li><p>Some (combinations of) vertical restraints are equivalent to other
restraints. Hence one should not abolish the former while allowing
the latter</p></li>
<li><p>Most common vertical restraints</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Payment schemes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>non-linear tariffs; e.g. two part tariffs \(T(q) = F + wq\)
with \(F\) franchise fee and \(w\) wholesale price</p></li>
<li><p>Royalties</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Limiting parties’ rights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RPM: price ceiling, price floor, recommended retail price</p></li>
<li><p>quantity fixing</p></li>
<li><p>Tie-in sales: this we discuss in the lecture on Article 102</p></li>
<li><p>Exclusivity clauses: Exclusive dealing, exclusive territories,
selective distribution</p></li>

<li><p>question 1</p>
<p>Consider the situation with one upstream firm \(U\) and \(n \geq
2\) downstream firms \(D_1,\ldots,D_n\). The upstream firm
produces inputs –with zero costs– for the downstream firms. Each
downstream firm needs one unit from the upstream firm to produce one
unit of the (homogeneous) final good. This final good is sold to
consumers with demand of the form</p>
<p>\begin{equation} p = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^n q_i \end{equation}</p>
<p>where \(q_i\) is the output level of firm \(D_i\). Downstream
firms only need the upstream input to produce, they incur no other
costs. Downstream firms compete in quantities (Cournot competition).
Throughout this assignment, we assume that \(U\) makes
take-it-or-leave-it offers to the downstream firms. We consider
different forms of these offers made by \(U\).</p>
<p>(a) [5 points] Calculate the monopoly output and monopoly profit in
this market (upstream and downstream combined).</p>
<p>First, assume that \(U\) uses a linear tariff \(wq\) that is
observable to everyone. Hence, \(D_i\) pays \(U\) price \(w\)
per unit of the input bought and \(D_i\) knows that \(D_j (j
\neq i)\) pays the same wholesale price per unit.</p>
<p>(b) [5 points] Show that \(q_1,\ldots,q_n\) are determined by
\begin{equation} 1-2q_i-\sum_{j \neq i} q_j-w=0 \end{equation}
\(i=1,\ldots,n\). Show that in symmetric equilibrium, we have
\begin{equation} q = \frac{1-w}{n+1} \end{equation}</p>
<p>(c) [5 points] Show that \(U\) chooses \(w\) to solve
\begin{equation} \label{eq:5} \max_w w(1-w)\frac{n}{n+1}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>and prove that upstream profits equal</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:6} \pi_U = \frac{1}{4}\frac{n}{n+1}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>How do these profits compare to your answer under (a)? Why is
\(\pi_U\) increasing in \(n\)? [hint: we want the intuition
here, not the derivative of \(\pi_U\) with respect to \(n\).]</p>
<p>Now consider the situation where \(U\) uses publicly observable
contracts of the form \((q_i,T_i)\) which specifies for each
\(D_i\) amount of input \(q_i\) bought from \(U\) and fee
\(T_i\) paid to \(U\) for this amount of inputs.</p>
<p>(d) [5 points] Give a set of profit maximizing contracts
\((q_1,T_1),\ldots,(q_n,T_n)\) for \(U\). What is the level
of \(U\)’s profits? Does this depend on \(n\)?</p>
<p>Finally, assume that \(U\) uses contracts of the form
\((q_i,T_i)\) (as above) but now \(D_i\) does not observe the
contract that \(D_j\) (\(j \neq i\)) receives. In other words,
\(U\) cannot commit to stop negotiations with downstream firms.</p>
<p>(e) [5 points] Explain why this contractual environment is different
from (d). Why are downstream firms’ beliefs important in this case?</p>
<p>(f) [5 points] Assume that downstream firms have symmetric beliefs.
That is, if \(D_i\) gets offered \((q_i,T_i)\), she believes
that \(D_j (j \neq i)\) gets offered \((q_i,T_i)\) as well.
Show that \(U\) chooses contract \((q,T)\) where \(q\) solves</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:7} \max_q nq(1-nq) \end{equation}</p>
<p>What profit does \(U\) receive? Does this profit depend on \(n\)?
How is the outcome here related to (d)?</p>
<p>From now on, we assume that firms \(D_i\) have passive beliefs. In
the symmetric equilibrium that we consider here, passive beliefs
imply the following. Suppose that in equilibrium \(U\) is supposed
to offer each \(D_i\) the contract \((q,T)\). If \(D_i\)
receives a different contract \((q’,T’)\), \(D_i\) still beliefs
all other downstream firms received contract \((q,T)\).</p>
<p>(g) [5 points] Show that with passive beliefs, \(U\) cannot earn
the monopoly profit in a symmetric equilibrium.</p>
<p>(h) [5 points] Show that in a symmetric equilibrium where each
downstream firm receives contract \((q,T)\), \(q_i =q\) solves</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:9} \max_{q_i} q_i(1-(n-1)q-q_i)
\end{equation}</p>
<p>(i) [5 points] Show that in symmetric equilibrium we find \(q =
1/(n+1)\) and \(U\)’s profits equal \(\pi_U = n/(n+1)^2\). Why
is \(\pi_U\) decreasing in \(n\)? [hint: we are not asking for
a derivative here, but the reason why \(\pi_U\) is decreasing in
\(n\).]</p>
<p>(j) [5 points] Suppose that \(U\) can offer \(D_1\) an exclusive
contract. That is, the contract makes clear that \(q_2=\ldots =
q_n=0\). Would \(U\) offer such a contract to \(D_1\) under
(c), (d), (i)? Explain why (not).</p>

<li><p>question 2: question 3 from <a class="reference download internal" download="" href="_downloads/417219a89040e6205a194a16a28dffc8/exam_June_2014.pdf"><code class="xref download docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exam</span> <span class="pre">June</span> <span class="pre">2014</span></code></a></p></li>
<li><p>question 3 [exam 2009]: Manufacturer-distributor contracts</p>
<p>A monopolist, \(M\), sells its product through 2 retailers. For
simplicity, we assume \(M\)’s production costs are zero. Each
retailer has a fixed cost of 2 and marginal retailing cost of 1.
Consequently, if the monopolist sells to the retailers for a
wholesale unit price \(w\), the cost function of retailer \(i\)
is \(C_i(q_i)=2+(1+w)q_i\). The demand for the product is
\(D(p)=10-p\). The retailers compete in quantities, hence, a la
Cournot.</p>
<p>(a) [5 points] Suppose \(M\) charges each retailer the same
wholesale price \(w\). What is the quantity that retailer \(i\)
will bring to the market in this case? What will be the market price?
What is the maximum wholesale price that a retailer is willing to
accept?</p>
<p>(b) [5 points] The monopolist wants to maximize its profits. Given
the Cournot behaviour of the retailers, what wholesale price \(w\)
will the monopolist set? What will be the resulting market price?
What is total welfare in this case?</p>
<p>(c) [5 points] The monopolist is not happy with the outcome from (b).
He is considering exclusively supplying only one retailer, hence, not
supplying the other. What would be the consequences for the market
outcome? What would be the effect on welfare?</p>
<p>(d) [5 points)] Suppose M would indeed act as in (c) and not supply
the second retailer. Could this retailer complain to the competition
authority and argue that \(M\) is violating one of the European
competition rules? Is so, which one? Would the complaint have a
chance of success?</p>
<p>(e) [5 points] The monopolist is reconsidering its strategy and moves
to more sophisticated wholesale market behaviour. Given the symmetry
of the retailers, \(M\) offers each retailer the same contract. A
contract \((F, w, q)\) specifies the fixed fee \(F\) the retailer
has to pay to \(M\), the wholesale price per unit, \(w\), and the
amount \(q\) that M will supply to the retailer. Confronted with
such a contract, each retailer knows that its competitor will also
have this contract, and the offer is take it of leave it. (That is,
the retailer cannot negotiate about the parameters of the contract.)
Demonstrate that in the optimal contact for the monopolist we will
have \(w = 0\) and \(q = 2.25\). What will \(F\) be? As
compared to (b), what has happened to total welfare and consumer
surplus? What is the intuition?</p>
<p>(f) [5 points] If the monopolist behaves as in (e), is it violating
any of the European competition laws? If so, which one? Make sure to
sufficiently motivate your answer.</p>

<span id="id4"></span><h2>Article 102<a class="headerlink" href="#article-102" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any <em>abuse</em> by one or more undertakings of a <em>dominant
position</em> within the common market or in a
substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the
common market insofar as it may affect trade between Member States.</p>
<p>Such abuse may, in particular, consist in:</p>
<p>(a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices
or other unfair trading conditions;</p>
<p>(b) limiting production, markets or technical development <em>to the
prejudice of consumers</em>;</p>
<p>(c) applying <em>dissimilar conditions</em> to equivalent transactions with
other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive
disadvantage;</p>
<p>(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the
other parties of <em>supplementary obligations</em> which, by their nature or
according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of
such contracts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>how can we interpret this?</p></li>
<li><p>problem with <em>abuse</em> and <em>dominant position</em> is that these concepts
are not well defined.</p></li>
<li><p>dominant position is often established in terms of market shares. For
this we need a definition of the relevant market which is not easy in
Article 102 cases (because of cellophane fallacy)</p></li>
<li><p>Article 102 does not prohibit firms from holding a dominant position,
the problem is abusing such a position</p></li>
<li><p>A firm in a dominant position has a “special responsibility” not to
allow its conduct to impair undistorted competition on the common market</p></li>
<li><p>ECJ has defined (in <em>United Brands v Commission</em>) a dominant position
as “a position of economic strength enjoyed by an undertaking which
enables it to prevent effective competition being maintained on the
relevant market”</p></li>
<li><p>However, it is not quite clear what “effective competition” means</p></li>
<li><p>In <em>Hoffman-La Roche</em> and <em>Michelin</em> abuse was identified as practices
which “through recourse different from those governing normal
competition … have the effect of hindering the maintenance or
development of the level of competition still existing on the market”</p></li>
<li><p>It is not quite clear what “normal competition” means</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore economists have argued that an “effects based” approach
should be used where the criterion is whether certain conduct reduces
consumer welfare (goal should not be to protect competitors)</p></li>
<li><p>since the same practice can have different effects in different
circumstances, economists tend to favor a “case-by-case” or <em>rule of
reason</em> approach not a <em>per se</em> approach where some practices are always
abolished and other practices are always ok (“safe harbor”)</p></li>
<li><p>unfair prices: excessive pricing is an example here. It is hard for
the Commission to determine when a price is excessive (one should not
expect \(p = mc\) in every market). Also if it would be established
that a price is excessive, the Commission would have to regulate the
price as a remedy. Commission does not have enough information to do
this. Therefore there are very few excessive pricing cases and these
types of problems are subsumed into price discrimination cases.</p></li>
<li><p>limiting production or technical development: these are signs of
market power that a firm is able to limit production and/or limit
technical development; as we will see below tying is an example where
firms can do this</p></li>
<li><p>to the prejudice of consumers: Another suggestion that the Commission
is more concerned with consumer welfare rather than total welfare
(including firms’ profits)</p></li>
<li><p>dissimilar conditions: think here of price discrimination, although
from an economic point of view it is not clear that price discrimination
is bad for welfare</p></li>
<li><p>supplementary obligations: e.g. forcing firms to accept exclusive
dealing or to buy a product in which they are not interested (tying)</p></li>

<h3>Predatory pricing and non-price predation<a class="headerlink" href="#predatory-pricing-and-non-price-predation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Commission wants to abolish behavior by firms that excludes rivals
(deterring entry or inducing firms to exit) at the expense of
consumers</p></li>
<li><p>One way in which this can happen is predatory pricing in the sense
that a firm chooses a low price today to drive (keep) out (potential)
competitors and then raise the price after these firms have left</p></li>
<li><p>We will first formalize this idea using asymmetric information</p></li>

credible: only subgame perfect equilibrium is Entry,Accommodate</p></li>
<li><p>This suggests that one should not observe predation in reality</p></li>
<li><p>However, this is a game of complete information, with
asymmetric information predation can make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>\(E\) does not know type of \(I\): aggressive vs
rational type</p></li>
<li><p>\(E\) does not know cost level of \(I\): low vs high
cost</p></li>
<li><p>capital market imperfection and (re)financing of \(E\)</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Asymmetric information about incumbent</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If \(I\) plays this game repeatedly (because there may be
different entrants over time or because \(I\) is active in
different markets) and if there are “irrational” types of
\(I\) who always fight, it can be profitable for \(I\) to
fight entry to gain a reputation of being “irrationally”
aggressive and in that way prevent future entry</p></li>
<li><p>\(E\) may not know the marginal costs of \(I\); if \(I\)
has low marginal costs, it is not profitable for \(E\) to
enter; hence \(I\) may already choose a low price before
\(E\) enters (not in response to entry as above) to signal
that it has low costs and therefore entry will not pay off</p></li>
<li><p>In each of these cases \(I\) chooses a short run action (low
price) which is loss making except for its exclusionary effect
(preventing \(E\) from entering or forcing a firm out)</p></li>
<li><p>After the entrant has left or after the threat of entry has
disappeared, one would expect \(I\) to raise its price to
recoup the initial loss</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Capital market imperfection</p>
<ul>
<li><p>\(I\) charges a low price now to make sure that other firm(s)
make a loss reducing their retained earnings (equity)</p></li>
<li><p>Because of capital market imperfection (moral hazard) bank only
(re)finances firms if they have enough equity (if almost all of
a firm’s profits have to be paid to the bank as interest on
debt, owner of the firm will not invest much effort)</p></li>
<li><p>By reducing opponents’ profits, \(I\) can reduce their equity
and hence they exit if their (re)financing breaks down</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly, \(I\) should have enough equity not to endanger its
own finances by pricing so aggressively</p></li>
<li><p>Again we see initially a low price (which is not profit
maximizing for \(I\) except for its exclusionary effect) and
a recoupment after opponents have left the market.</p></li>

after a firm leaves, then this is not necessarily a predation
case; e.g. “competition on the merits” like Cournot competition
will show the same pattern</p></li>
<li><p>approaches to detect predation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Sacrifice test</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>As-efficient competitor test</em> and <em>consumer harm test</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>ECJ and Commission</em>: \(p &lt; AVC\) and \(AVC &lt; p &lt; ATC\)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>each of these tests have their own pros and cons, none is perfect</p></li>
<li><p>Sacrifice test</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Idea is that dominant firm in the short run makes a sacrifice
(loss in profits) that only pays off because other firms are
eliminated</p></li>
<li><p>The test asks whether the conduct in question would be
profitable (or make business sense) but for its tendency to
lessen competition</p></li>
<li><p>Question is: sacrifice relative to what? How can we determine
in practice whether an action chosen by the dominant firm
reduces its profits?</p></li>
<li><p>one approach is to identify prices below average variable cost
as a sacrifice but this has disadvantages as we discuss below</p></li>
<li><p>Other problem: with <em>tying</em> it is possible to predate without
sacrificing anything (<em>no cost predation</em>)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>As-efficient competitor test and consumer harm test</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Here the question is whose exclusion should be prevented by the
Commission</p></li>
<li><p>Intuitively, if inefficient firms are removed from the
industry, this is competition on the merits and there should be
no intervention</p></li>
<li><p>But if the dominant firm’s conduct removes opponents from the
market that are equally or more efficient than the incumbent,
the dominant firm has something to explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Problem is that there may be firms less efficient than dominant
firm that add social value but are removed by the dominant
firm’s conduct</p></li>
<li><p>This suggests that one should test directly whether the
dominant firm’s conduct harms consumers by excluding firms</p></li>
<li><p>Disadvantage here is the information needed to establish such a
loss in consumer welfare</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>ECJ and Commission test</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, the firm in question should have dominant position (say,
market share above 40%); otherwise it is unlikely that it will
be able to recoup after (the threat of) other firms have left</p></li>
<li><p>Second, prices below average variable costs are <em>per se</em>
predatory</p></li>
<li><p>Third, price below average total cost but above average
variable cost are regarded as abusive if they are (can be shown
to be) part of a plan to eliminate a competitor (intent)</p></li>
<li><p>There is some discussion on what the right cost concept is here
(see Motta 447-449)</p></li>
<li><p>There are two problems with these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prices below average variable (or total) costs that are not
predatory</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When there is a demand shock (or cost shock) it may not
be feasible for a firm to stop production once \(p &lt;
AVC\) as it may lose loyal customers</p></li>
<li><p>Promotional pricing: when you invent a new razor blade
you may want to give these away in the beginning (or
price very low) to let consumers try it and convince
themselves that this blade is superb</p></li>
<li><p>Network effects: when there are network effects it is
important to create a network of users (e.g. Adobe Reader
which is given away for free) this may involve pricing
below costs in the beginning</p></li>
<li><p>learning curve: producing a lot in the beginning helps
workers to improve efficiency to reduce costs later on;
to generate high output levels you have to charge a low
price (perhaps below current variable costs)</p></li>
<li><p>Complementary products: give mobile away but charge high
prices for calls</p></li>
<li><p>Inefficient entry can force incumbent to price
(temporarily) below variable costs</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Prices above average variable (or total) costs that are
predatory:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>None of the three models above formalizing predatory
pricing said anything about \(I\) pricing below its own
costs</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Non-price predation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scheduling: two bus companies offer a service between A and B;
company 1 leaves A at .00, .15, .30 and .45 and company 2
schedules .59, .14, .29 and .44. This keeps customers away from
company 1 and reduces consumer welfare as consumers would
prefer a service every \(7.5\) minutes</p></li>
<li><p>investing in excess capacity to commit to aggressive response
after entry</p></li>
<li><p>brand proliferation to fill up the product space (think of all
the different breakfast cereals produced by one company like
Kellogg)</p></li>
<li><p>Hi-tech industries: Microsoft does not want to reveal all the
relevant application programming interfaces (APIs) of the
Windows operating system to its rivals</p></li>
<li><p>Hi-tech industries (like software and pharmaceutical industry)
feature very low marginal costs but high fixed costs; hence a
price above average variable costs may already be predatory as
it does not allow opponents to recoup their sunk investment
costs in R&amp;D</p></li>

<h3>Price discrimination<a class="headerlink" href="#price-discrimination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Commission tends to a <em>per se</em> prohibition of price discrimination by
dominant firms</p></li>
<li><p>In <em>Michelin</em> Commission stated that with “the exception of short
term measures, no discount should be granted unless linked to a
genuine cost reduction in the manufacturer’s costs”</p></li>
<li><p>In <em>Virgin/British Airways</em>:</p>
<p>“Such commission schemes carried out by a firm enjoying a dominant
position … are illegal”</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is more motivated by the political goal of a single market than
by economic analysis</p></li>
<li><p>From an economic point of view, price discrimination can raise
welfare as illustrated in the following example of third degree price
discrimination:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Two countries \(A\) and \(B\), consumer in country \(i\)
buys at max. one unit valued at \(n_i\) with \(n_A &gt; n_B\);
fraction of consumers in \(A\) denoted by \(\phi\), cost of
production for monopolist \(c \leq n_B\)</p></li>
<li><p>If firm can price discriminate between countries, it charges
\(p_i = n_i\) in country \(i\); total welfare equals
\(\phi (n_A - c) + (1-\phi) (n_B -c)\)</p></li>
<li><p>If firm cannot price discriminate between the countries: \(p_A =
p_B =p\), firm can choose either \(p=n_A\) and profit equals
\(\phi (n_A - c)\) or \(p=n_B\) and profit equals \(n_B
-c\); firm does not serve \(B\) country if \(\phi (n_A - c)&gt;
n_B -c\)</p></li>
<li><p>Hence for \(\phi\) and \(n_A\) big enough (compared to
\(n_B\)) total welfare is reduced by a prohibition of price
discrimination</p></li>
<li><p>As a rule of thumb: welfare is raised through price discrimination
if it raises total output compared to a uniform price</p></li>
<li><p>In the <em>Glaxo</em> case, Glaxo sold its products at a higher price in
the UK than in Spain and prevented parallel imports into the UK by
quantity quotas in Spain; Commission held that these quantity
quotas were illegal</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For price discrimination to be feasible two conditions need to be
satisfied</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>firm must be able to sort consumers (either through observable
characteristics like age or through self selection)</p></li>
<li><p>firm should be able to prevent arbitrage</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example of second degree price discrimination (self selection):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Two types of consumers \(A\) (fraction \(\phi\)) and \(B\)
with utility function \(n_i \sqrt{q_i}\) where \(n_A &gt;
n_B\), production costs \(cq\)</p></li>
<li><p>if the firm can price discriminate, it will offer two bundles
\((q_A,T_A),(q_B,T_B)\) which solves
\begin{align*} &amp; \max \phi (T_A - cq_A) + (1-\phi)(T_B -
cq_B) \ \text{subject to} &amp;(IR_A)~ n_A \sqrt{q_A} - T_A
\geq 0 \ &amp;(IC_A)~ n_A \sqrt{q_A} - T_A \geq n_A
\sqrt{q_B} - T_B \ &amp;(IR_B)~ n_B \sqrt{q_B} - T_B \geq
0 \ &amp;(IC_B)~ n_B \sqrt{q_B} - T_B \geq n_B \sqrt{q_A}
- T_A \end{align*}</p></li>
<li><p><em>TODO</em> show that \((IR_A)\) is implied by \((IC_A)\) and
\((IR_B)\); argue why \((IC_B)\) is unlikely to be binding
(and check your solution afterwards) <strong>check</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Then it follows that \(T_B = n_B \sqrt{q_B}, T_A = n_A
\sqrt{q_A} - (n_A - n_B) \sqrt{q_B}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Solve
\begin{equation} \max_{q_A,q_B} \phi (n_A \sqrt{q_A} -
(n_A - n_B)\sqrt{q_B} - cq_A) + (1-\phi)(n_B \sqrt{q_B} -
cq_B) \end{equation}</p></li>
<li><p>If firm can only offer one option \((q,T)\), it can either only
serve \(A\) or serve both \(A\) and \(B\); profits are resp.
\(\max_{q_A} \phi (n_A \sqrt{q_A}-cq_A )\) and
\(\max_{q} (n_B \sqrt{q}-cq )\)</p></li>
<li><p><em>TODO</em> we find that forcing a firm to offer the same deal to
everyone reduces welfare for \(\phi\) and \(n_A\) big enough
because type \(B\) is no longer served <strong>check</strong></p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Concern of the Commission is that through tying or bundling a firm is
able to leverage market power in one market to another market such
that prices go up in the latter market</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, tying is used to exclude rivals (predation) leading
indirectly to higher prices</p></li>
<li><p>Here we consider markets \(X\) and \(Y\) that are horizontally
related (vertically related markets were discussed above):</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fig9" src="_images/tying.png" /></p>

\(Y\) (e.g. games)</p></li>
<li><p>\(M\) can foreclose \(C\) if \(Y\) cannot be consumed
without \(X\) and \(M\) makes \(X\) incompatible with
\(Y’\); however it is not obvious that this is profitable for
\(M\) (see below)</p></li>
<li><p>If \(Y\) has only value to consumers if \(X\) is bought as
well, \(M\) has a tendency to price low in the \(Y\) market.
This is not necessarily predatory as higher sales of \(Y\) make
\(X\) more attractive to consumers and \(M\) internalizes this
externality</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(M\) charges \(C\) a royalty \(\rho &gt;0\) for
each unit of \(Y\) sold. Does this create an unlevel playing
field by raising \(C\)’s marginal costs compared to \(M\)? No,
for each unit that \(M\) sells of the \(Y\) good, it misses
the royalty \(\rho\) (opportunity cost) hence both \(M\)’s
and \(C\)’s marginal costs are raised by \(\rho\)</p></li>

<li><p>\(M\) is incumbent and \(C\) is potential entrant with

<li><p>If \(M\) commits to selling the bundle \(X+Y\) before \(C\)

deterred from market</p></li>
<li><p>However, if \(C\) does enter then this bundling is very costly
for \(M\) as it loses its monopoly profit on \(X\)</p></li>
<li><p>The following three strategies allow \(M\) to exclude rivals at
low (or no) cost (no cost predation)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Underpricing</em> \(Y\) by \(M\): Assume \(X\) and \(Y\)
are consumed in fixed proportions, \(c_Y^M = c_Y^C =
c_Y\), \(M\) and \(C\)’s versions of \(Y\) are perfect
substitutes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>let \(p_X^m\) denote monopoly price of \(X\): \(p_X^m
= \arg \max_p \{ pq_X(p) - c_X q_X(p) \}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of selling the products at \(p_X^m,c_Y\),
\(M\) decides to price at \(p_X^m + \varepsilon\) and
\(c_Y - \varepsilon\)</p></li>
<li><p>This does not reduce the demand for the \(X+Y\)
combination as the total price remains \(p_X^m + c_Y\),
however all \(C\) firms are removed from the market as
they have to sell at \(p_Y \geq c_Y\)</p></li>
<li><p>This is predation at no cost to \(M\) (not even in the
short run)</p></li>
<li><p>Further, this makes entry into \(X\) market harder as well
since there are no separate \(Y\) producers anymore</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Threat to overprice</em> \(X\): \(M\) threatens consumers that
they have to pay \(p_X^m+ \varepsilon\) to buy \(X\)
unless they buy \(Y\) from \(M\) as well</p>
<ul>
<li><p>threat to overprice \(X\) is almost costless (second order
loss in terms of profits since \(p_X^m\) maximizes
profits) and in equilibrium it is not carried out</p></li>
<li><p>leads to elimination of \(C\) firms (making future entry
into \(X\) market harder)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Reducing rivals’ values</em>: instead of raising rivals’ costs,
\(M\) can reduce the value of \(C\)’s products in the eyes
of consumers by bundling \(X\) and \(Y\)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Suppose \(C\) has a superior version of \(Y\) (i.e.
\(v_Y^C - c_Y^C &gt; v_Y^M - c_Y^M\)); however by
bundling \(X\) and \(Y\) consumers only buy from \(C\)
if \(v_Y^C - v_Y^M \geq p_Y^C\)</p></li>
<li><p>Hence if \(v_Y^C - v_Y^M &lt; c_Y^C\) firm \(M\) can
keep superior firms \(C\) out of the market</p></li>
<li><p>this strategy is especially profitable for \(M\) if
\(M\) fears that entry into the competitive \(Y\)
segment facilitates entry into profitable \(X\) segment</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>bundling as an entry barrier</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider a more elaborate model of bundling based on Nalebuff (2004)</p></li>
<li><p>Assume that (initially) \(M\) is monopolist in both \(X\) and
\(Y\) markets</p></li>
<li><p>\(C\) can enter in either market with probability
\(\textstyle{1\over 2}\)</p></li>
<li><p>by bundling \(X\) and \(Y\) it becomes harder for \(C\) to
enter in either market and this entry deterrence comes at little
cost for \(M\) (even after \(C\) has entered)</p></li>
<li><p>\(C\) can more profitably enter (for given prices by \(M\)) if
it enters both \(X\) and \(Y\) market simultaneously
(competition in bundles) but this is more costly and thus harder</p></li>

<li><p>question 2</p>
<p>This question is on price discrimination and abuse of a dominant
position. Consider a monopolist that can produce quantity \(q\)
at costs \(0.5 cq^2\) with \(c&gt;0\). This monopolist has one
customer who can be either of two types. The monopolist cannot
observe its customer’s type. It only knows that with probability
\(\phi \in [0.5, 1 \rangle\) the utility function of the
customer is given by \(u_l = \theta_l q -t\) and with
probability \(1-\phi\) it is given by \(u_h = \theta_h q
-t\) with \(\theta_h &gt; \theta_l &gt;0\) and \(t\) denotes the
fee paid by the customer to the monopolist. If the customer (of
either type) does not buy from the monopolist, she has (outside)
utility equal to 0. The monopolist needs to incur fixed cost
\(f&gt;0\) to advertise its product to the customer (otherwise the
customer does not know that the monopolist exists).</p>
<p>(a) [5 points] Let \(q_l^{*},q_h^{*}\) denote the first best
output levels for the low and high customer type, where first best
output maximizes total welfare for each type. Assuming first best
output levels are positive, show that</p>
<p>\begin{align} \label{eq:11} q_l^{*} = \theta_l/c \ q_h^{*}
= \theta_h/c \end{align}</p>
<p>(b) [5 points] Assume that the monopolist creates two options
\((q_l,t_l)\) and \((q_h,t_h)\) and that the customer can
choose one option (only). Show that the monopolist’s expected profits
can be written as</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:12} \pi = \phi (t_l - 0.5
cq_l^2)+(1-\phi)(t_h - 0.5 cq_h^2)-f \end{equation}</p>
<p>where two constraints need to be taken into account:</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:13} \tag{$IR_l$} t_l \leq \theta_l
q_l \end{equation}</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:14} \tag{$IR_h$} t_h \leq \theta_h q_h
\end{equation}</p>
<p>(c) [5 points] Explain why the monopolist also needs to take the
following two constraints into account:</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:15} \tag{$IC_l$} \theta_l q_l -t_l
\geq \theta_l q_h -t_h \end{equation}</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:16} \tag{$IC_h$}
\theta_h q_h -t_h \geq \theta_h q_l -t_l \end{equation}</p>
<p>(d) [5 points] By adding the two constraints under (c), show that
\(q_h \geq q_l\). What is the interpretation of this inequality?</p>
<p>(e) [5 points] Show that \(IC_h\) and \(IR_l\) imply
\(IR_h\). Give the intuition for this result.</p>
<p>It turns out that \(IC_l\) is not binding. [we are telling you
this, you don’t need to prove this.]</p>
<p>(f) [5 points] Show that \(t_l =\theta_l q_l\) and \(t_h =
\theta_h q_h - (\theta_h -\theta_l)q_l\).</p>
<p>(g) [5 points] Write down the monopolist’s profits as a function of
\(q_h,q_l\) and show that</p>
<p>\begin{align} \label{eq:17} q_l &amp;= \frac{\theta_l}{c}
-\frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \frac{\theta_h-\theta_l}{c} \ q_h &amp;=
\frac{\theta_h}{c} \end{align}</p>
<p>Compare \(q_l,q_h\) to first best values
\(q_l^{*},q_h^{*}\) and discuss why they are (not) equal.</p>
<p>From now on, we assume that \(\theta_l=1,\theta_h=2,c=1,f=5/9\)
and \(\phi=3/4\).</p>
<p>(h) [5 points] Compare \(t^h/q^h\) with \(t^l/q^l\). Is it the
case that the customer type who buys more pays a lower price per unit
(i.e. is there a quantity discount)? Why (not)?</p>
<p>(i) [5 points] The European commission notes that \(t_l/q_l \neq
t_h/q_h\) and claims that there is price discrimination. On the
basis of what article in EU can law can the commission claim that
price discrimination is not allowed? Phrase the relevant part of this
article in your own words. Why do economists tend to disagree that
price discrimination should be abolished under competition law?</p>
<p>(j) [5 points] The commission also notes that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:4} \frac{t_l}{q_l} &lt; \frac{0.5 c
q_l^2 + f}{q_l} \end{equation}
and claims that the firm is guilty of predatory pricing. Which test
for predatory pricing does the commission have in mind here? Which
(other) test would not lead to a conclusion of predatory pricing?
Discuss whether you think that there is predatory behaviour by the
monopolist in this case.</p>
